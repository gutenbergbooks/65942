<br /><span class="h2line2">A STRANGE GUEST</span></h2>
<p>Thirteen-year-old Jim Hudson thumped a melon with
practiced fingers, then pulled it from the vine and laid it
in a pile with the others. He wiped his hot forehead with
his sweaty shirtsleeve, turning with a smile toward his
mother. &ldquo;Look, Ma!&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;See how many melons
we have. And how fine the turnips and corn look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma Hudson, her rifle across her knees, was sitting on a
large stump in the little clearing. She turned at the sound
of Jim&rsquo;s voice, and smiled wearily at her towheaded
boy. &ldquo;Yes, Jim. We&rsquo;ll have plenty to eat this winter,
I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Jim moved on to another vine and glanced along the
row to where his father was kneeling. Ma pushed her
sunbonnet back over her faded yellow hair and resumed
her watch into the wilderness surrounding the clearing.</p>
<p>All during the spring and summer the Hudsons had
worked in this fashion. Jim and Pa had planted their
crops and enlarged the clearing by felling trees, while Ma
had sat ready with the Kentucky rifle, and looked for hostile
Indians.</p>
<p>This year of 1777 was a fearful one for Kentucky settlers.
Some had been captured or killed by Indians;
others had returned to Virginia discouraged by repeated
Indian attacks. The Hudsons, however, had not been
molested and Pa Hudson was determined to stay on his
land. It was the first farm he had ever owned; he loved
every inch of this lush Kentucky wilderness. He and
Jim continued to gather melons. Jim worked faster
than his father, because each time Pa moved from one
vine to another, he had to pick up his rifle lying close by
on the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Suddenly Jim raised his head and listened. Then he
turned to his father. &ldquo;Pa, I hear something groaning. Do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa seized his rifle and was on his feet immediately.
&ldquo;Where, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim cocked his head toward the right. &ldquo;Over there.
Listen. There it is again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Ma Hudson called, &ldquo;Pa, I hear groaning.&rdquo;
She was already picking her way among the
stumps toward the sound, the rifle grasped firmly in her
hands.</p>
<p>Pa went striding through the melon patch. &ldquo;Wait, Ma.
Let me go first.&rdquo; Soon he was ahead of her, with Jim beside
him.</p>
<p>The three made their way through the tangled brambles
into woods so dense the Hudsons seemed to be walking
in twilight. Quite suddenly they saw a bridled horse
standing quietly just ahead of them. In a moment the
groaning sound came again, this time to the left of where
Jim was standing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>He whirled around, scrambled over a large fallen tree
and cried, &ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s a boy! Kind of a small boy, too.&rdquo;
Jim started to stoop down toward the prostrate form.</p>
<p>Pa sprang to his side. &ldquo;Wait a minute, son.&rdquo; He peered
through the gloom and saw an Indian boy smaller than
Jim, dressed in a long blue cloth shirt, his face streaked
with hideous vermilion. &ldquo;Maybe this is a trick,&rdquo; Pa muttered.
&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s been put here to lure us into a trap.&rdquo;
Holding his rifle ready, Pa started looking about in the
shadowy woods.</p>
<p>Ma Hudson&rsquo;s hands trembled as she held her rifle and
looked down at the boy. &ldquo;Pa, he&rsquo;s hurt. Look at his
shoulder. This is no trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa handed his rifle to Jim. &ldquo;You watch with Ma, while
I have a look at him.&rdquo; He dropped to his knees to examine
the boy, mumbling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still afraid it&rsquo;s an Indian
trick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>As Pa turned the boy to one side, he saw an ugly wound
where the blue shirt was torn from one shoulder. Then
he looked closely at the wound. &ldquo;Why, I can see a bone
too, Ma. I think he&rsquo;s broken his shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma forgot about the possibility of other Indians lurking
near, as she ventured closer to Pa to look at the boy again.
&ldquo;Pa, he&rsquo;s not as old as Jim. We&rsquo;ll have to take care of him.
We can&rsquo;t leave him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, reckon we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Pa replied, as he tried to lift
the Indian boy from the tangled underbrush. But the
boy&rsquo;s body was enmeshed in a stout wild grapevine. Pa
took out his long knife and began slashing at the tangled
vine.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Indian boy groaned and opened
his eyes. He looked up at the Hudsons in alarm. When he
saw Pa&rsquo;s long knife, he was terrified and cried out, &ldquo;<i>Shemolsea!
Shemolsea!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Jim asked, but the boy had lost
consciousness again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>When Pa had freed the boy from the vine, he gathered
him in his arms and turned to Jim. &ldquo;You go ahead
with the rifle, Jim, and Ma, you walk behind me. Mind
you both keep a sharp lookout. We&rsquo;ll have to take him
back to the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Pa,&rdquo; put in Jim, &ldquo;what&rsquo;ll we do about the horse?&rdquo;
He nodded toward the animal standing a few feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him along. And tie him up in our lean-to next
to Nellie. But not too close to our horse. She might nip
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hudsons took the boy and his horse back to their
cabin without seeing another human being. While Jim
tethered the horse at a safe distance from Nellie, Ma flew
about the cabin getting water, her home-made soap, and
clean rags for Pa. He set the wounded boy&rsquo;s broken bone
as best he could, supporting it with a rude splint. Then
with Ma&rsquo;s help, he washed the wound with soap and
bound the shoulder with rags to hold the bone securely in
place.</p>
<p>When they had finished Pa shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid he&rsquo;s lost a lot of blood. He&rsquo;ll be a while getting
well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Ma turned to Jim who was standing in the doorway of
the cabin. &ldquo;Jim, we&rsquo;ll have to put him in your bed. He&rsquo;s
awfully weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded. &ldquo;Sure, Ma. He&rsquo;s welcome to it. I can
sleep on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa Hudson laid the boy carefully on Jim&rsquo;s bed, muttering
all the while. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like harboring an Indian in my
house. No, sir, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then he turned to Jim. &ldquo;You
stand guard at the door with Ma&rsquo;s rifle and I&rsquo;ll go back
for the melons. Some Indians might come swooping in
here to get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma&rsquo;s eyes flashed as she stooped to pick up her rifle
from the floor. &ldquo;No, Jim. You go help your pa. I&rsquo;ll
stand guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; Jim said; he dashed
out to join his father.</p>
<p>When they had brought all the melons up to the cabin
and stacked them in the shade, they fed and watered the
Indian boy&rsquo;s horse. Inside the cabin again they found the
boy sound asleep. Now and then, Ma glanced at him as
she prepared supper. &ldquo;Shall we wake him, Pa, and give
him something to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Pa studied the Indian for a few minutes. &ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s
breathing all right but seems in pain. Probably wouldn&rsquo;t
want to eat anyway. Let&rsquo;s not bother him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper the Hudsons conversed in low tones.
&ldquo;Where do you suppose he came from, Pa?&rdquo; Ma asked.</p>
<p>Pa shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea, but now we know the Indians
have been near our farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma&rsquo;s blue eyes widened and she shivered slightly. &ldquo;It
makes me fearful, Pa. I&rsquo;ve never really been afraid before.&rdquo;
She laid a thin, work-worn hand on her husband&rsquo;s
brawny one. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim glanced quickly at his father and saw Pa&rsquo;s face set
in a stubborn mask. He was not surprised to hear his father
say, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go all the way back there alone, Ma.
It&rsquo;s too dangerous. And there&rsquo;s nothing back in Virginia
for us. We were indentured servants, remember. I want
to hang on to our farm, all four hundred acres of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Ma sighed and smoothed back her faded blond hair.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re free now, Pa. We finished our time of service
before we came out here three years ago. And I&rsquo;d like
Jim to have some schooling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa shook his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be no future for us in Virginia.
We have no money to start back there. Here we
have land, our own land. And this is going to be a wonderful
country. As for school, you can teach Jim the way
you&rsquo;ve been doing. Weren&rsquo;t you a governess in one of the
big houses of Virginia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim had been looking from one to the other of his parents,
his clear blue eyes sparkling. &ldquo;Please, Ma,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I want to stay here. You can teach me lots more, and I
can help Pa to clear and plant the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa nodded to Jim and smiled in approval. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
big men out here, too, from the finest families of Virginia.
Men like James Harrod, Robert Todd, Simon Kenton
and George Rogers Clark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly remember Clark, Ma. His father&rsquo;s land
joined where we worked. George Rogers Clark will figure
out some way to stop the redskins. You surely don&rsquo;t
intend to let one lone Indian boy scare you away from our
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma tried to smile. &ldquo;No. No Pa, of course not. But we
can&rsquo;t be sure there aren&rsquo;t other Indians near at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Pa agreed. &ldquo;You and Jim go to bed.
I&rsquo;ll sit up for a while and listen for any unusual sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay up with you. Jim, I&rsquo;ll
make a pallet for you.&rdquo; She got up and fixed a comfortable
bed on the floor for Jim. Then she sat down in the
cabin doorway beside her husband.</p>
<p>Jim glanced at the Indian boy lying so quietly in his
bed, dropped down on the pallet and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Ma and Pa Hudson continued to sit in the doorway,
rifles by their side, and to stare out into the silent black
night.</p>
<p>When Jim awakened the next morning, Ma had breakfast
ready and the Indian boy was looking solemnly at
him from his bed.</p>
<p>Jim jumped up. &ldquo;Good morning, boy,&rdquo; he said with a
smile. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The Indian boy did not reply but kept his brown eyes
fixed on Jim.</p>
<p>Ma put a pewter bowl containing steaming hot grits at
Jim&rsquo;s place on the table. &ldquo;Wash your hands and face,
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m.&rdquo; Jim poured some water into the washbasin
and began splashing water on his face and hands. As
soon as he had finished he carried a pan of water to their
strange guest, so he could wash his face.</p>
<p>But the Indian boy just stared at him and did not move.</p>
<p>Ma came over and stood beside the boy. &ldquo;Come now,
boy,&rdquo; she said briskly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wash your hands and face.
Then you must have some breakfast.&rdquo; As she turned one
hand over and began to wash it, he tried to sit up, but fell
back on the bed with a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor boy. Your shoulder must hurt badly.&rdquo; Ma tried
to soothe him as she continued with the washing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have to get this awful stuff off your face.&rdquo; But when she
began scrubbing his face, he groaned again and tried to
turn away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it means something to him to wear that vermilion
streak,&rdquo; Jim suggested. &ldquo;Looks like mud, doesn&rsquo;t
it? Or it could be he doesn&rsquo;t like water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma wasn&rsquo;t able to get the Indian boy&rsquo;s face thoroughly
clean. She brought a bowl of hot grits to him. &ldquo;Here,
boy, try to eat some of this.&rdquo; She held a spoonful of grits
to his lips.</p>
<p>The boy tasted it gingerly, found it good and opened
his mouth for more. Ma fed him the contents of the bowl
while Jim and Pa ate their breakfast.</p>
<p>For several days the Hudsons&rsquo; strange guest rested in
Jim&rsquo;s bed. Now and then he tried to sit up only to lie
down again with a low moan. With Ma&rsquo;s good food,
however, and excellent care, he did improve and seemed
to be less frightened at being with the white family.</p>
<p>Little by little he and Jim began trying to talk to each
other. By signs, gestures, and a word or two, each boy
began to learn a few words of the other&rsquo;s language.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Jim learned that the Indian boy&rsquo;s name was Wahbunou,
which meant The Juggler, and that he had been
pulled from his horse when it galloped under a large
thorn tree. One of the low branches had brushed him off
and a large thorn had pierced his shoulder. He had fallen
on a jagged stump and into the tangled wild grapevine,
where the Hudsons had found him. But Jim was not
able to find out what he was doing near their clearing.</p>
<p>As for Pa, he was disturbed because the Indian boy had
been riding so near their farm. Every night after Ma and
Jim were asleep, he rose from his bed and sat in the cabin
doorway with his rifle ready. But no Indians appeared.</p>
<p>Sometime later Wahbunou was able to be up and about
in the cabin. He would watch Pa clean and oil his Deckard
rifle, but he never offered to touch it. Soon he began
walking around the clearing with Jim and Ma Hudson.
He followed Ma everywhere, gratitude for her care shining
in his brown eyes.</p>
<p>One morning Pa said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d best have a look at that
shoulder, Wahbunou, to see if it&rsquo;s healing properly.&rdquo; But
when Pa tried to remove the rag bandage, Wahbunou
jerked away like a wounded animal, terror in his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Wahbunou, I just want to look at it,&rdquo; Pa
said. &ldquo;I promise not to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Wahbunou would not permit Pa to touch the
bandage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can show him something new, Pa, and get
him calmed down a bit so you can have a look,&rdquo; Jim suggested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get your drum, Pa. Maybe he&rsquo;s never seen a
drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa shrugged. &ldquo;Indians have drums, Jim, though not
like ours. All right, get it down for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim climbed on a chair and lifted Pa&rsquo;s drum from its
place on the top of Ma&rsquo;s high cupboard. &ldquo;Look, Wahbunou.&rdquo;
Jim took the drumsticks and played a short ruffle
on the drum.</p>
<p>Wahbunou seemed interested; he smiled as he reached
for one of the sticks. He grasped it gingerly, turning it
over and over, finally returning it to Jim who played another
ruffle and a loud roll. Wahbunou smiled again and
reached for the drum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Jim nodded. &ldquo;If you let Pa look at your shoulder, you
may have it.&rdquo; Jim pointed to the Indian boy&rsquo;s shoulder
and then to his father.</p>
<p>Wahbunou drew back, but finally nodded.</p>
<p>Pa took the bandage off, and gently pulled the rough
splint back far enough to look at the boy&rsquo;s shoulder. Then
as gently, he replaced it. &ldquo;Your wound is healing fine,
Wahbunou. Soon you&rsquo;ll be as good as new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim handed the drum to Wahbunou and the Indian
boy beat out a queer, rhythmical sound with the palm of
his hand. He didn&rsquo;t seem to know how to use the drumsticks.
Then the boys took turns beating it. Jim could
make many fancy rolls and ruffles, but Wahbunou could
make only the one sound.</p>
<p>One day was like another at the cabin until nights began
to grow much cooler. Pa said any day now there
would be a frost, so they&rsquo;d soon have to harvest the turnips
and corn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Wahbunou&rsquo;s shoulder healed nicely and Pa finally took
off the bandage and splint. Now that it was cooler and
his shirt was in shreds, Ma said Wahbunou should have a
new outfit of clothes. She had been sewing for Pa and
Jim, so she made Wahbunou a homespun shirt and trousers.
In his new clothes Wahbunou looked like any Kentucky
boy, save for his copper-colored skin and straight,
coarse black hair.</p>
<p>Not many days after Pa had removed Wahbunou&rsquo;s
bandage, Ma awakened Pa and Jim earlier than usual.
&ldquo;Jim! Pa!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Wake up! He&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone! Who&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo; Pa asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wahbunou. He&rsquo;s not in his bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim had scrambled into his clothes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably
outside, Ma,&rdquo; he cried as he dashed out-of-doors. But
when Jim looked around their dooryard and in the shed,
he saw that Wahbunou&rsquo;s horse was gone. He ran back
into the house. &ldquo;Pa, Wahbunou <i>must</i> be gone. His horse
isn&rsquo;t in the shed with Nellie, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hudsons could not believe that Wahbunou would
leave without telling them good-bye; they spent a long
time looking for him. But Wahbunou and his horse were
nowhere in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Finally Ma fixed breakfast. As she put bowls on the table,
she sighed and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why he
wanted to leave us. He recovered so nicely and seemed
happy here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked up from his food. &ldquo;But Ma, maybe he
wanted to go back to his own people. I sure would if I
were with the Indians or some other strange folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma shrugged and brushed her hair back from her
forehead. &ldquo;That was the wrong thing for him to do, Jim&mdash;&mdash;go
away without telling us good-bye. Sneaking off
in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa looked up at his wife, his brown eyes thoughtful.
&ldquo;Now, Ma, I don&rsquo;t think he did anything so wrong. He
was probably afraid we would try to keep him from going,
so he just left quietly in the night. I don&rsquo;t believe he
was ungrateful. As Jim says, he probably longed for his
own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim finished his breakfast in silence and then suddenly
said, &ldquo;Do you suppose some of the Indians came for
him?&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s eyes flashed in excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Pa picked up his rifle and put on his homespun jacket.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they did, Jim, but I&rsquo;ll have a look around to
see if there are new tracks of any kind. I believe I would
have heard them. He probably just rode off alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma began to take away the pewter bowls. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
it at all. I feel queer, as if we were surrounded by Indians.
I&rsquo;m afraid we aren&rsquo;t safe here any more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WAS IT A TRICK?</span></h2>
<p>Not long after Wahbunou&rsquo;s disappearance, a chill north
wind blew into the lush Kentucky valley, warning the
Hudsons that winter was not far away. Frosty mornings
greeted them, and the trees putting on their mantles of
brown, red and gold, told them it was time to harvest
both turnips and corn.</p>
<p>Jim and Pa spent several days gathering them, while
Ma did sentinel duty sitting on a stump with her rifle
ready for use. But she was uneasy while on guard, jumping
at each snap of a twig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Finally the corn was shucked and piled high in one
corner of the cabin. Pa stored the turnips in a deep hole
near the lean-to, so they would keep all winter. One nippy
day when the harvest was finished, Pa turned to Jim after
breakfast. &ldquo;Jim, let&rsquo;s go hunting today. I&rsquo;d like to lay in
a supply of game before it gets any colder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s blue eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Today, Pa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s as good as any time, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma looked troubled. &ldquo;Must you go, Pa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa nodded and patted his wife&rsquo;s shoulder awkwardly.
&ldquo;Now Ma, you&rsquo;ve been nervous and upset ever since
Wahbunou went away. I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d want us to go
hunting. Only yesterday you said you were tired of living
on rabbit. You&rsquo;ll be all right here, but don&rsquo;t leave the
cabin. We&rsquo;ll be home by early evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma squared her shoulders and bristled a little. &ldquo;Pa, I
haven&rsquo;t been any more upset than usual. You know I&rsquo;ve
never liked this country; I want to go back to Virginia.&rdquo;
She sighed. &ldquo;I do know we need fresh meat. Well, I&rsquo;ll
spend the day spinning my flax.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Pa&rsquo;s brown eyes sparkled in relief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good girl,
Ma. Who knows? Maybe we&rsquo;ll get a deer. Then you&rsquo;ll
have a deerskin to make a jacket and some leggings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or maybe we&rsquo;ll get a bear,&rdquo; Jim boasted.</p>
<p>Soon they were ready to go. Jim was dressed exactly
like his father. Each wore home-made moccasins, fur
caps, loose thin homespun trousers, topped by long
fringed hunting shirts reaching nearly to their knees.
Their shirts were held in at the waist by broad belts.</p>
<p>Pa hung his long knife from his belt and Jim started
down the clearing, carrying Pa&rsquo;s heavy flintlock rifle. It
was as long as Jim was tall and difficult for him to carry,
but he tried to manage it proudly.</p>
<p>As Pa went striding through the thick woods, Jim did
his best to keep up with him. Now and then a squirrel
darted along in front of them, or a few wild turkeys flew
over their heads, frightened by their approach.</p>
<p>Jim stopped and started to raise his rifle. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s shoot
some turkeys, Pa. Ma always likes to cook turkey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Pa smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;Not now, Jim. We&rsquo;re
out for bigger game. On the way back we&rsquo;ll bag a few
squirrels and turkeys. Then we won&rsquo;t have to carry them
so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther on, Pa said, &ldquo;If you should happen to
see a bear or deer, Jim, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry to fire. Wait
until the animal is close to you. That Deckard works best
if you fire it at close range. Always remember, son, don&rsquo;t
get excited and fire too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember, Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along about noon Jim suddenly froze in his tracks,
certain that he had seen a deer. Pa stopped, glanced in
the direction Jim was looking and nodded. The deer evidently
had not picked up their scent, as it continued to
wander slowly toward them.</p>
<p>Without a sound Jim brought his rifle to rest in a
nearby tree notch and waited. When it seemed the approaching
deer would surely see them, he fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Jim,&rdquo; Pa cried excitedly. &ldquo;You got him on
the first shot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="1090" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Jim was elated because it was his very first deer. Of
course he had shot rabbits near their cabin, but a deer
was a real triumph. Pa cut a long limb from a tree and
stripped off its branches. Then he trussed the deer&rsquo;s legs
with a long strip of wild grapevine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jim, help me to run this limb between the deer&rsquo;s
legs, so we can carry it easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a jiffy they had the deer slung from the limb. Pa
put one end of the limb on Jim&rsquo;s shoulder and the other
on his own, so they could carry the animal through the
forest without difficulty. It was a fine young buck, and
would furnish plenty of meat for them, perhaps even a
new hunting shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better give me the rifle now, Jim. It&rsquo;s most too heavy
for you with that limb on your shoulder. We&rsquo;ll work our
way home by Coon Hollow Trace. There&rsquo;s always plenty
of game in that neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they arrived at Coon Hollow, a small crossroads
in the forest, Jim said, &ldquo;Look, Pa. I think I see someone
coming down that trace.&rdquo; He nodded toward the north.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Instantly Pa laid the deer on the ground and held his
rifle ready. He peered ahead for a moment, then said,
&ldquo;I see two men, Jim, and I think one&rsquo;s leading a pack
horse. We&rsquo;ll wait a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the men came nearer, Pa suddenly recognized the
taller one. &ldquo;George Rogers Clark! As I live and
breathe.&rdquo; Then he raised his arm in greeting. &ldquo;Howdy,
Mr. Clark. I don&rsquo;t reckon you remember me. I&rsquo;m Jim
Hudson. I used to work the land bordering your father&rsquo;s
farm back in Virginia. And this is my son, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall, red-haired man looked at Pa Hudson for a
moment and then smiled, his hazel eyes shining and
friendly. He shook hands with Jim, then with Pa. &ldquo;Of
course I remember you, Hudson.&rdquo; He gestured toward
his companion. &ldquo;This is Tom Shelton. He&rsquo;s one of the
settlers going back to Virginia with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; Tom Shelton said, shaking Pa&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>George Rogers Clark looked inquiringly at the Hudsons.
Then he asked, &ldquo;What are you doing out here so
far from Virginia?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;We came out here three years ago,&rdquo; Pa replied, &ldquo;to
take up a claim. It&rsquo;s wonderful land; my boy and I are
clearing it as fast as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Pa talked about his dreams for his claim, Jim
stared at the splendidly built man his father had called
Mr. Clark. He was taller than Pa, young too, and most
impressive-looking.</p>
<p>Tom Shelton shook his head when Pa paused for
breath. &ldquo;No more Kentucky for me. I&rsquo;m beat. I can&rsquo;t
take these Indian raids any longer. Last week finished
me. My nearest neighbors were attacked and taken prisoners.
I got all my possessions with me.&rdquo; He nodded toward
the heavily laden pack horse. &ldquo;Many of us settlers
are going back with Colonel Clark. Better join us, Hudson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Clark!&rdquo; Pa exclaimed. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a colonel
now, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel seemed not to have heard Pa&rsquo;s exclamation.
He shook his head gravely. &ldquo;This Indian situation
is bad. They&rsquo;re more stirred up than ever this season.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Pa bristled. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no Indians going to scare me off
my land. I got a good warm cabin and quite a few acres
cleared. I&rsquo;m staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark nodded and smiled. &ldquo;I like your spirit,
Hudson, but if I were you, I&rsquo;d take my family and crops
up to Harrodsburg. Stay there until these Indians quiet
down a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa shook his head. &ldquo;I mean to stay, sir. I got through
last winter all right. We&rsquo;ve never been molested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark put his hand on Pa&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;We
could use more brave men like you out here, Hudson, but
the Indians are really on the warpath now. I can&rsquo;t prove
it, but I hear Hamilton&rsquo;s paying the Indians for all of the
prisoners they deliver to him at Detroit&mdash;paying them
well, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hamilton? Who&rsquo;s he, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The British commander in charge of all the western
country, stationed at Detroit. I hear he&rsquo;s got the Indians
really aroused. Better take your family to Harrodsburg
for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Pa scratched his ear. &ldquo;Harrodsburg? That&rsquo;s a far piece
from here. Why not to McClellan&rsquo;s Fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel looked grim. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard, Hudson?
Burned out by the Indians early this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over, Hudson,&rdquo; put in Tom Shelton. &ldquo;Better
stay alive in the fort than dead on your claim. Or better
yet, go back to Virginia with us. We&rsquo;ll be leaving in a
few days, won&rsquo;t we, Colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clark nodded. &ldquo;As soon as I get the settlers together
who want to go back with me. I&rsquo;ll be back in the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa shifted from one foot to the other. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good
news, sir, that you&rsquo;ll be back. Thanks for your advice.
I&rsquo;ll think it over, but I&rsquo;m not going back to Virginia. We
got to be getting along home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel shook hands again with Pa and Jim.
&ldquo;Glad to have seen you, Hudson. Good luck. Better get
up to Harrodsburg as soon as you can.&rdquo; He and Shelton
moved off along the trace.</p>
<p>When the men had gone and Jim and Pa had been
trudging along for a while, Jim asked, &ldquo;Pa, should we go
to Harrodsburg?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Pa didn&rsquo;t reply for so long Jim was afraid he had made
him angry. Finally Pa sighed and said, &ldquo;I know your
ma has been mighty upset since Wahbunou disappeared.
And Colonel Clark&rsquo;s not one to be aroused without cause.
Maybe we ought to take our meat and provisions to the
fort, at least until this Indian scare blows over. I wouldn&rsquo;t
want anything to happen to you and Ma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose our farm, Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t lose it, Jim. No Indian&rsquo;s going to squat
very long on our land. They&rsquo;re a roving people. The
worst they could do would be to burn our cabin, and we
could build another one, I guess. But I haven&rsquo;t made up
my mind yet, Jim. Better not say anything to your ma
about our meeting with Colonel Clark today. No use getting
her excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jim agreed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s upset enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I decide we should go,&rdquo; Pa continued, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll be
glad enough to leave the farm and stay at the fort. So
mind now, not a word to Ma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to worry Ma.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>On the way home they shot a squirrel and several wild
turkeys, so when they arrived at their cabin, they were
well laden with the day&rsquo;s trophies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pa!&rdquo; Ma cried, running out to meet them, her
blond hair flying. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never come.&rdquo; She
clapped her hands when she saw the deer hanging from
the limb. &ldquo;Oh, a deer! Now we&rsquo;ll have plenty of meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa smiled and pointed toward Jim. &ldquo;He shot the deer,
Ma. Got him on the first shot. We have a squirrel and
some turkeys too, so we&rsquo;ve a lot of work to do these next
few days, jerking this meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning was quite cold as a north wind had
risen in the valley during the night. But the Hudsons began
working early anyway. Jim helped Pa cut the deer
meat into long strips and spread it to dry in the sun.</p>
<p>Pa glanced toward the sun. &ldquo;I think maybe we&rsquo;ll have
to smoke this meat after all, Jim. This sun isn&rsquo;t warm
enough to cure meat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Once the norther had passed, however, the weather did
warm considerably; Pa said they were feeling the last
breath of summer. While father and son worked with the
meat, Ma made two new shirts for them and a linsey
woolsey dress for herself. She didn&rsquo;t mention Indians
again, but she seemed to be uneasy as soon as night fell.</p>
<p>On the evening they had the meat laid by, Pa said casually
to his wife, &ldquo;Ma, I think we&rsquo;ll take our provisions
and go up to Harrodsburg for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim glanced quickly at his father to see if he had seen
or heard anything alarming, but Pa&rsquo;s face showed nothing
at all.</p>
<p>Ma gasped in surprise. &ldquo;To Harrodsburg, Pa? Do you
mean to the fort? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve noticed you seem mighty jumpy lately and
I thought we&rsquo;d take our provisions and join the settlers at
the fort for a while. It would give you a rest and a chance
to hear the news and talk to someone else besides me and
Jim. It would be a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma&rsquo;s face glowed in anticipation and relief. &ldquo;Oh, Pa,
let&rsquo;s do it. Let&rsquo;s go tomorrow before winter sets in and
makes us prisoners here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Pa shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure we can go tomorrow.
But we&rsquo;ll start packing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma leaned forward in her chair and searched her husband&rsquo;s
face anxiously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s made you decide to leave
our cabin, Pa? Have you seen signs of Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked at his father again as Pa replied almost too
casually, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen anything, Ma. But we&rsquo;ve done
the chores and the harvesting, so we can leave the farm
for a spell now. Just got a hankering to see people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa&rsquo;s answer seemed to satisfy Ma Hudson because she
was up early next morning, and beginning to pack before
Jim and Pa were awake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my pots and the spinning
wheel,&rdquo; she said after breakfast, glancing around
their cabin.</p>
<p>Pa shook his head. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take all that stuff, Ma.
We&rsquo;ve only one horse, remember. We can&rsquo;t put everything
we own on Nellie&rsquo;s back. They&rsquo;ll have cooking
utensils at the fort and I&rsquo;m sure some one will have a
spinning wheel. We&rsquo;ll take just the corn, turnips and
all of our meat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I take your drum, Pa?&rdquo; put in Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry it.
I can have fun playing it for the other boys at the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa hesitated, glancing up at the drum. Then he
smiled. &ldquo;I guess if you want to be responsible for it, you
may take the drum. But mind, you hang on to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally they had the corn packed in two stout cloth
sacks and hung on one side of their horse&rsquo;s saddle. Pa
put the meat in a peddler&rsquo;s pack which he had brought
from Virginia, with most of the turnips on top of the
meat. This pack he slung from the other side of the
horse&rsquo;s saddle.</p>
<p>Ma had tied a change of clothes and moccasins for each
of them in a large square of cloth.</p>
<p>When they were ready to leave, Ma sat on the horse,
holding the pack of clothes, while Pa led the horse with
one hand and carried his trusty Deckard with the other.
Jim walked behind the horse, carrying Ma&rsquo;s rifle, the
treasured drum and drumsticks.</p>
<p>As they left their clearing Pa said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come home
as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>They trudged along silently, their moccasins and the
horse&rsquo;s hoofs, swishing softly through the fallen leaves.
Sometimes Ma hummed softly to herself as if she were
happy to be on the way to Harrodsburg. But Pa gazed
resolutely ahead.</p>
<p>They heard no other sounds for a mile or so.</p>
<p>Then without warning, they found themselves surrounded
by a dozen hideously painted Indians. Neither
Pa nor Jim could raise their rifles before the Indians had
seized and securely bound them.</p>
<p>In trying to raise his rifle, Jim had dropped his drum
and sticks, but he was too frightened to notice this.</p>
<p>Ma screamed in terror as one of the Indians leaped
upon her horse Nellie, tied Ma&rsquo;s hands and rode off with
her into the woods. Two other Indians tied leather
thongs around Jim and Pa&rsquo;s waists and began dragging
them along behind Ma&rsquo;s captor.</p>
<p>The rest of the band picked up the rifles, drum and
sticks and followed along, their whooping and yelling
piercing the calm autumn stillness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Jim was terrified. He wondered if his father were; yet
he could do nothing but stumble along behind the Indian
who kept jerking the leather thong.</p>
<p>Although Jim was frightened, he did not forget what
Pa had said when they found Wahbunou in the woods.
Had it been a trick? Were these Indians some of Wahbunou&rsquo;s
people? Was this the thanks the Hudsons received
for caring for him?</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN EXCHANGE AT THE SALT LICK</span></h2>
<p>The Indians dragged Jim and his father rapidly
through the woods until the Hudsons thought they could
go no farther. They were happy to reach a small clearing
where more Indians were waiting with their women,
children and extra horses. To Jim&rsquo;s relief he saw his
mother still sitting on their old Nellie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>During her ride, Ma&rsquo;s usually neat blond hair had
fallen down over her shoulders. Half a dozen women
were crowding around her, fingering her hair and talking
excitedly to each other. When they caught sight of Jim&rsquo;s
towhead, they laughed and ran their fingers over his
hair, too.</p>
<p>Several men were going through the peddler&rsquo;s pack of
food. After one look, they dumped the turnips on the
ground. But the meat they carefully repacked.</p>
<p>Pa tried to smile reassuringly at Ma and Jim, but one
of the men clapped him on the head, picked him up as
though he were a feather and dumped him head down
across a horse. Then the Indian climbed on behind him.
In a moment a second man had done the same to Jim.
At once the band rode off with their three white prisoners
toward the north.</p>
<p>About dusk they stopped for the night by a small
stream. Pulling the Hudsons from their horses, they tied
Pa and Jim to one tree, Ma to another. Several women
began making fires and filling kettles with water; while
other women prepared supper. The children laughed
and scampered in and out of the stream. The men paid
no attention to their three white prisoners, but sat quietly
along the bank of the stream, talking in very low tones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s head ached so badly from his jolting, upside-down
ride through the woods that he could scarcely see.
He was glad, though, that his parents were still with him.
He looked at the half-grown children playing around the
camp, expecting to see Wahbunou, but the boy was not
among them.</p>
<p>Ma Hudson was still so frightened she couldn&rsquo;t talk,
but she was not so shaken up as Pa or Jim, because she at
least had ridden upright.</p>
<p>When supper was ready, one old woman brought scant
servings of stew in small gourds to the Hudsons, and three
small dry corncakes. Ma wasn&rsquo;t able to eat a bite, but Pa
and Jim found the stew surprisingly good. They could
have eaten another helping, but the woman did not bring
them any more.</p>
<p>After the Indians had eaten their fill, the women
banked the fires for the night; men and boys relaxed on
the ground. Poor Ma Hudson had either fainted from
fright or had fallen into an exhausted sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Pa turned his head slightly toward Jim and whispered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it was a trick, Jim. Putting Wahbunou with
his injured shoulder near our clearing, I mean. He probably
reported we could be taken prisoner easily, since we
had no near neighbors to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim glanced toward the Indian group, then at his father.
&ldquo;But, Pa, Wahbunou isn&rsquo;t with these Indians. All
the men and boys are sitting right over there together.
Besides, we don&rsquo;t even know if this is Wahbunou&rsquo;s tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa looked at the group. Then he nodded his head.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, son. He isn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim wriggled a bit trying to loosen the thongs which
bound him, but with no success. &ldquo;I wonder what they&rsquo;ll
do with us now, Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa tried to shake his dark hair away from his eyes.
&ldquo;Well, since they didn&rsquo;t kill us on the spot, I wonder if
they intend to deliver us to Hamilton in Detroit. You
remember Colonel Clark said the British commander
there was paying the Indians to bring white prisoners to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Jim nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I remember. But why, Pa? And
where is this Detroit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember when I was in Harrodsburg last year
I heard about Great Britain waging a war with our countrymen
back east. Now I think this British Hamilton in
Detroit is figuring on winning all our Kentucky territory
by having the Indians fight for him. They are to scare the
settlers into returning back home or to capture them for
Hamilton. I&rsquo;m not sure where Detroit is, but I think it
lies far to the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim glanced toward the Indians again. &ldquo;Look, Pa.
They have our rifles and drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men were examining the rifles carefully, while the
rest of the Indians were passing drum and sticks from
hand to hand. One of them began to beat the drum with
his hand, making a low rhythmical sound similar to what
Wahbunou had made in the Hudson&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Jim listened intently to the Indians&rsquo; conversation, but
he couldn&rsquo;t understand anything. The words sounded
like those Wahbunou had taught him, yet they were
somehow different, so that Jim couldn&rsquo;t get even an idea
of what was said.</p>
<p>At last they stopped talking and began rolling in their
blankets to sleep. Two men came over to the Hudsons,
untied Pa and Jim, dragged them to separate trees and
secured them again. One Indian rolled in a blanket beside
Jim and the other beside Pa. But they offered no
blankets to them, nor to Ma Hudson now fifty feet away.</p>
<p>The next morning they gave their prisoners a small
amount of food. Ma tasted it and ate a little, but Pa and
Jim ate all the Indians gave them. After breakfast, the
women packed all the camp equipment together; the
men tied the Hudsons&rsquo; hands, set them upright on horses
and scrambled up behind them.</p>
<p>The entire party rode rapidly toward the north and
west, arriving late in the afternoon at the broad Ohio
River. The men chopped down poplar trees and began
building a raft. Jim and Pa Hudson watched in amazement
to see how quickly these Indians completed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Then they ferried women, children and equipment
across the river. While some Indians guided the raft, others
swam their horses to the far side. When all were safely
transported, the band set up their camp for the night.</p>
<p>For several days they continued in a northwesterly direction.
On a bright cool day they stopped at noon at a
salt lick. The Hudsons realized the Indians would stay
here for a while, because the women dug a trench, filling
it with a great amount of firewood.</p>
<p>When their fires had burned to a bed of red-hot coals,
they drew water from the lick and poured it into big salt
kettles. These they placed over the hot glowing coals.
Some women kept adding firewood to keep the salt water
boiling; others began cooking over a second fire.</p>
<p>Pa, Ma and Jim were permitted to walk about the salt
lick as far as the long leash around their waists permitted.
But the Indians tied them to trees far enough apart so
they could not come close to each other. Pa always would
smile encouragingly at Ma and Jim, but he was never
permitted to touch them. Two Indians were stationed to
watch the prisoners, to prevent their escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="1076" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The Indians wanted to build up their supply of salt, so
the trench fires under the kettles were not allowed to go
out. Several women took turns piling on firewood during
the first night.</p>
<p>In the evening one man brought Jim&rsquo;s drum to him,
gesturing for him to play it. Jim played his loudest and
best, executing ruffles and long rolls for their entertainment.
The Indians loved these sounds and his skill with
drumsticks, so kept him playing until quite late.</p>
<p>The next afternoon a new group of Indians arrived at
the lick; but they kept a long distance away from the
trench fires and did not offer to mingle with the first
band. They also set up camp and dug a long trench, making
a fire and filling their kettles with the brine. This
salt lick was evidently common ground, since neither
Indian band paid attention to the other.</p>
<p>By nightfall, the women were able to scrape the first
salt from the kettles, spread it on rough boards to dry,
and to fill the kettles with fresh brine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Again the men had Jim play his drum for them. Soon
they were swinging their bodies and clapping their hands
in time with the drum. Once by the light of campfires,
Jim thought he saw shadowy figures creeping close, as if
to listen to his playing. He felt uneasy about what they
wanted, but he continued to play even louder than before.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the women finally decided they
had enough salt for the winter, they began packing their
kettles and preparing to leave the salt lick. A few minutes
before the band was ready to go, Jim saw four stalwart
Indian men advancing rapidly toward them from
the other camp. They came near and began making a fire
in front of Jim&rsquo;s group.</p>
<p>The men of Jim&rsquo;s camp held a hurried consultation.
Then one of them stepped forward, raising his right arm
high above his head. Immediately the four visitors came
up to him. He motioned for them to be seated; he and
his companions sat down, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>As they talked, Jim thought they must be arguing
about some important question. After a long conversation,
one visitor rose and walked back to his camp. He
soon returned with a white man bound exactly like Pa
Hudson.</p>
<p>At a signal from the group sitting on the ground, Jim&rsquo;s
guard suddenly untied his leash and led him over to the
strangers.</p>
<p>More arguing went on, but the men of Jim&rsquo;s camp kept
shaking their heads. Again one visitor returned to his
camp, carrying back a handsomely painted buffalo robe
which he spread in front of the council. Jim&rsquo;s band examined
the robe carefully and nodded their heads. One
of them called to the watching men. Immediately an Indian
brought Pa Hudson&rsquo;s drum and sticks to the council.</p>
<p>The visitors rose from the ground, handed their white
prisoner and the buffalo robe to Jim&rsquo;s band, and motioned
to Jim to pick up his drum and sticks. As soon as Jim
obeyed, one visitor picked up his leash and led him toward
the other camp.</p>
<p>Frightened now, Jim looked back at his parents. Pa
was alarmed and Ma, tearful, was holding out her arms
toward him, but both of them were still tied to the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>When Jim reached the new camp, several men and boys
swarmed around him. From their midst, a strangely familiar
figure rushed over to Jim and took off his leash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim! Jim!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me? I&rsquo;m
Wahbunou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim dropped his drum in surprise as Wahbunou gave
him a friendly thump on the shoulder. &ldquo;Wahbunou!&rdquo; he
gasped.</p>
<p>Wahbunou was so excited he could scarcely speak, but
he had much to tell his friend Jim. &ldquo;My father and I persuaded
Chief Minnemung to trade our white prisoner for
you. We couldn&rsquo;t bear to see you remain with the Shawnees.
Then we Potawatomis made a fire in front of their
camp to show we wanted to counsel with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shawnees!&rdquo; Jim cried out in terror, looking back toward
his father and mother. The Shawnees, however,
were now mounted and moving away from the salt lick.
Jim could still see his parents riding on separate horses
with their Indian guards, and looking hopelessly toward
the Potawatomi camp where Jim had gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Jim turned frantically to Wahbunou. &ldquo;Wahbunou&mdash;&mdash;my
parents! Where are they going? Don&rsquo;t let the
Shawnees take them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou shook his head sadly. &ldquo;I tried, Jim, I really
did. I wanted to have your parents traded to us along
with you. But Chief Minnemung was interested only in
you and your drum. The drum helped me arrange the
trade, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drum? What do you mean, Wahbunou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other night,&rdquo; Wahbunou began, &ldquo;we heard you
playing your drum. It was the first time my people, the
Potawatomis, had heard such playing. I knew it was not
an Indian beating that drum, because I had heard you
play like that in your cabin; so I persuaded Chief Minnemung
and my father to creep close to the Shawnee
camp to listen. It was then I saw you and your parents.
I realized you were prisoners of those Shawnees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my parents, Wahbunou. Why aren&rsquo;t they here
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Wahbunou continued patiently. &ldquo;I asked Chief Minnemung
to see if he could get all of you transferred to us.
I told him and all our Potawatomi clan how good you
were to me when I hurt my shoulder. I pleaded, but Chief
Minnemung wanted only you and your drum. Why Jim,
he traded his handsomest buffalo robe for your drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my parents will be unhappy separated from me,&rdquo;
Jim persisted.</p>
<p>Wahbunou sighed and nodded. &ldquo;I know, Jim. But I
think no harm will come to them now, because the Shawnees
are on their way to Detroit to deliver their prisoners
to the great British Hamilton. He pays the Indians well
for white prisoners.&rdquo; Wahbunou picked up the drum and
sticks. &ldquo;Come, Jim, I want you to meet my family because
soon we will be breaking camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou&rsquo;s parents, brothers and sisters welcomed
Jim heartily into their group. His mother stroked Jim&rsquo;s
towhead and said, &ldquo;Welcome, friend. We Potawatomis
will be good to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>In a short time the Indians began packing to leave the
salt lick. When they were ready, Wahbunou said, &ldquo;Jim,
you are to ride with me because we do not have extra
horses.&rdquo; He led Jim over to his horse. Jim recognized it
as the one he had tied in their lean-to alongside Nellie.</p>
<p>The boys climbed up on the horse. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Wahbunou
explained, &ldquo;we are going to our winter camp. It is still a
long distance away. Hang on tight, Jim, because we&rsquo;ll
be riding hard today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim did as he was told, but with a heavy heart. Here
he was&mdash;going to some strange place with Wahbunou
and the Potawatomis, while his mother and father were
prisoners of the Shawnees. He swallowed hard, wondering
if he would ever see them again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WINTER WITH THE POTAWATOMIS</span></h2>
<p>The Potawatomis rode hard for several days against a
biting northwest wind. Finally they stopped on the banks
of the <i>Au Sable</i> River, in a wide valley protected by rolling
hills. It was an ideal camp site because the hills protected
the Indians from bitter winter winds.</p>
<p>Several families had already arrived. Wahbunou told
Jim that these people were members of another clan in
his tribe. His clan, the Golden Carp, always tried to return
to this camp to hear news of their relatives and to
share in the tribe&rsquo;s winter sports.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The women began immediately setting up wigwams.
These they made with poles fastened to the ground in a
circle, and the tops drawn together in a cone. They covered
this framework with their <i>aquapois</i>, or reed mats
made of cattail flags, to shut out snows and winter winds.</p>
<p>The men rested a few days, then decided to go on a
short hunting trip to get fresh meat. Early in the morning
of the hunt, the men painted their faces with the vermilion,
which Jim had first seen on Wahbunou&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wahbunou,&rdquo; Jim said, &ldquo;why are the men painting
their faces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou turned from watching his father prepare
for the trip. &ldquo;They always wear it, Jim, when they go
hunting or riding for a war raid. The day you found me
in your country, I was on a hunting trip with my father
and the other men. But I became separated from the rest.
I was trying to catch up with them when I was brushed
off my horse and broke my shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you usually hunt near our farm?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. That was the farthest south and east we had
ever ridden. But hunting wasn&rsquo;t good in the places we
knew. If you had not found me I would have died, because
my people did not miss me until they returned to
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked puzzled. &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t they hunt for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, for several days. My father said they finally
gave me up for lost, thinking I had been killed by a bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t a trick that you happened near our
clearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trick?&rdquo; It was Wahbunou&rsquo;s turn to look puzzled.
&ldquo;What do you mean, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim hesitated. &ldquo;My father wondered if you had been
placed near our farm to spy on us, and see if we could be
easily captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim! My people would not do that. We have not
raided any cabins this year. The prisoner we traded to
the Shawnees had fired on Chief Minnemung. We had
to capture him. And anyway, Chief Minnemung wanted
his knife and gun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>While the boys talked the men finished their preparations
and were ready to go. Suddenly Chief Minnemung
swung down from his horse and walked toward Jim.
&ldquo;You ride with me today,&rdquo; he said, putting his hand on
Jim&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Wahbunou gasped in surprise because none of the Indian
boys had been asked to go on this hunting trip. Jim
looked up at the tall, haughty chief, magnificent in his
painted buffalo robe; he started to say he didn&rsquo;t care to go.
But the expression on Minnemung&rsquo;s face told him this
was not an invitation but a command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, sir,&rdquo; he managed, wishing with all his heart
he did not have to accompany the chief. &ldquo;What shall I
do to get ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Minnemung looked at him for a moment. &ldquo;All
right as you are. Come.&rdquo; Then he turned and stalked
back to his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great privilege, Jim,&rdquo; Wahbunou whispered,
still amazed by the chief&rsquo;s order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Jim got on the horse behind the chief and the party
of eighteen set out for the hunt. After they had ridden a
little way into the forest, they separated into groups of two
or three going in different directions.</p>
<p>But Chief Minnemung and Jim went alone. As they
rode along Jim noticed that the chief was carrying a rifle
like his father&rsquo;s, and wearing a long knife also like his father&rsquo;s
in a wampum belt which girded his beautiful robe.</p>
<p>Jim pointed to the rifle. &ldquo;You have a gun like my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Minnemung grinned a hideous grin through his
streaked vermilion paint. &ldquo;<i>Shemolsea</i>,&rdquo; he grunted.
Then he patted the big knife and again said, &ldquo;<i>Shemolsea</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Chief Minnemung reined in his horse. Then
he tried to sight his rifle, but could not do it on the horse,
so slid quietly to the ground. Once again he tried to sight
the rifle. Jim looked to see what the chief&rsquo;s quarry was.
In the distance he saw a black bear, but it was too far
away to shoot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The Indian kept fumbling with the rifle and suddenly
the sound of a shot broke the stillness of the forest. Chief
Minnemung shouted in triumph and dropped the gun.
He had fired the rifle. But his triumph was short-lived,
for his shout was answered by an unearthly moan. He
had wounded the bear which was now charging toward
him. The old chief stood frozen in his tracks when he
realized the rifle shot had not killed the bear.</p>
<p>Jim slid off the horse, grabbed the rifle from the
ground, reloaded it and waited. The bear was coming
nearer and Jim knew he must not miss his aim. The
wounded animal would kill them, if he did not kill it
first.</p>
<p>When the bear was only a few feet away, Jim fired.
This time the aim was deadly accurate, piercing the bear
between the eyes. It fell in its tracks.</p>
<p>Chief Minnemung waited a few moments, then turned
to Jim. &ldquo;White boy, Jim, you have saved Chief Minnemung&rsquo;s
life. I will not forget this moment. Minnemung
not know how to use <i>Shemolsea</i> gun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="1071" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The old chief was quite shaken and nervous, but with
Jim&rsquo;s help, he managed to truss the bear and get it back
to camp. When the women and children saw Jim and
Chief Minnemung returning with the big bear, they ran
out to meet them, yelling in delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear meat!&rdquo; Wahbunou cried. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have a
feast. Chief Minnemung got a bear with <i>Shemolsea</i>
gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief was grinning in delight, but never a word
did he say about Jim&rsquo;s shooting the bear. He took all the
credit for the kill and did not so much as glance at Jim.
Jim would have liked to tell Wahbunou he had killed the
bear, but he was afraid Chief Minnemung would be angry,
so he said nothing.</p>
<p>Late in the day the other men returned with squirrels
and wild turkeys, but no large game. For several days the
camp feasted on bear meat, while all the Indians praised
their chief for bringing home such a prize. The chief still
kept silent about Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Soon winter came to the camp and the ground was covered
with snow. Then the children had lots of fun. Wahbunou
showed Jim how to make a sled, using buffalo ribs
for the runners and hides for the seat. Jim found it was
a fine sled and had fun coasting down the hills with the
other children.</p>
<p>One morning when the snow was packed very hard,
Wahbunou said, &ldquo;Come on, Jim, we&rsquo;re going to play
Snow Snake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow Snake? What kind of game is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We play it by teams with snow-snake poles,&rdquo; Wahbunou
explained. He took Jim to a long level playground
in the valley where the other children had gathered.
They chose sides, having six to a team. Then they drew
lots to see who would throw the first pole. Wahbunou
drew the first throw.</p>
<p>He picked up the hickory pole, the ends of which were
carved like the head of a snake. He held it high and
threw it with all his strength. The pole shot through the
air for quite a distance and fell to the ground far from
him. An older boy and girl served as scorekeepers and
measured the length of its flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jim,&rdquo; Wahbunou urged, &ldquo;do your best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Jim stepped forward and tried to throw the pole as far
as Wahbunou had, but it fell far short. Jim sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
no good at this game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon learn, Jim,&rdquo; comforted Wahbunou.</p>
<p>Jim did learn to throw the snow-snake pole as well as
the other boys. Sometimes Chief Minnemung walked out
to watch the children; he always smiled when Jim threw
it farther than the others. Quite often during the winter
the chief called Jim to his Wigwam, to play Pa Hudson&rsquo;s
drum for him and sometimes for all the Indians.</p>
<p>Jim grew tall during the winter, had plenty of food and
was snug and warm in the wigwam. He would have been
happy with the Potawatomis if only his parents had been
with him. But often at night he could not sleep, because
he kept seeing his parents riding sadly away with the
Shawnees.</p>
<p>After a long, cold winter, spring came again to the valley.
One fine day Wahbunou told Jim he had heard the
men say they would be moving out of winter camp the
next morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;But tonight, Jim,&rdquo; Wahbunou went on, &ldquo;we shall
watch the dance of the women. This dance celebrates the
beginning of our summer wanderings. Then we&rsquo;ll break
up into small bands again and we won&rsquo;t see the rest of
our clan until next winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked doubtful. &ldquo;The dance of the women, Wahbunou?
What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see, Jim. Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the women came out of their wigwams in their
ceremonial dresses, Jim scarcely recognized any of them.
They had greased their hair until it shone in the glow of
the campfires, painted their faces with vermilion and put
on long white chemises, over which they had strung all
the wampum necklaces they possessed.</p>
<p>At their appearance four or five young men began singing
and beating the dance rhythm on their Indian
drums; often they shook the <i>si si quoi</i>, a sort of gourd
containing dry seeds. The women danced in graceful
rhythm, not missing a single step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Jim thought the dancing beautiful, but he didn&rsquo;t enjoy
it as much as the Indians, because he grew very sleepy
long before the dance was over. He didn&rsquo;t know it would
last well into the night.</p>
<p>The next morning, however, the camp was awake early
with everyone getting ready to move. The women packed
wigwam poles, cattail mats, kettles, winter buffalo robes
and the rest of the camping equipment. Wahbunou&rsquo;s
mother packed Jim&rsquo;s drum carefully among her belongings,
so that he wouldn&rsquo;t have to carry it on the horse.</p>
<p>All the Indians put on their summer clothes, one-piece
garments of red or blue cloth. Wahbunou gave Jim one
of his blue cloth shirts, just like the one he had been wearing
when the Hudsons found him. Then everyone
mounted their horses. Once again Jim rode with Wahbunou.</p>
<p>Chief Minnemung started northward with his group.
Jim was to learn they would be constantly on the move
during the spring and summer, as the Potawatomis had
no lands of their own to cultivate. Frenchmen and some
neighboring Indian tribes called them squatters because
of their habit of moving in on land claimed by both the
French and Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>As they moved back and forth across the Illinois country
searching for game, wild berries and edible roots and
herbs, spring gave way to summer. Now the prairie grass
was as high as Jim&rsquo;s head and the woods dense with foliage.</p>
<p>One morning while Jim was helping Wahbunou&rsquo;s
mother skin some squirrels, Wahbunou wandered away
on some mission of his own. Wahbunou didn&rsquo;t like to
work; he specially didn&rsquo;t want to skin squirrels, so he always
managed to get away when his mother needed him.
He was gone only a few minutes, however, then came
rushing back. &ldquo;Jim. Jim, Chief Minnemung wants to
see you at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim put down a squirrel and looked up. &ldquo;Chief Minnemung?
Where is he? I wonder what he wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou pointed to a group of men under a tree.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s over there. See? Talking with my father and some
of the other men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Jim turned to Wahbunou&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back soon.
Chief Minnemung wants to speak to me.&rdquo; Then he
walked over toward the group of men.</p>
<p>At his approach the men nodded and walked away
from their chief. Minnemung smiled at Jim and motioned
for him to sit down beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said, laying his hand on the boy&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;I
have been watching you all winter and spring. Now I
have come to a great decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim waited, wondering what the old man would say
next.</p>
<p>Chief Minnemung leaned toward the boy, his brown
eyes stern and serious. &ldquo;I have decided to adopt you as
my own son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adopt me!&rdquo; Jim gasped, a chill of fear passing over
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The old chief continued as though Jim had not spoken.
&ldquo;I lost my only son two years ago with a fever. That fever
took four of our most promising young men. I have been
lonely, very lonely in my wigwam. But I have watched
you all during the time you have been with us. I remember
also that you saved my life on that hunting trip when
I did not know how to use the rifle of the <i>Shemolsea</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Minnemung did not take his eyes from the trembling
boy. &ldquo;But the greatest test of all you passed easily.
You did not belittle me in front of my clan by telling
them that you killed the black bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was startled. He hadn&rsquo;t realized that Minnemung
would have lost the esteem of his clan if the Indians discovered
Jim had really killed the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; Chief Minnemung continued, &ldquo;you have
proved yourself worthy of adoption into the Potawatomi
tribe as my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adoption,&rdquo; Jim murmured. It was the last gift he
wanted, because it would mean he would be forever cut
off from his own people. &ldquo;But sir&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have the adoption ceremonies when the clans
gather early in the fall,&rdquo; the chief said. &ldquo;I just wanted to
tell you of this honor which awaits you.&rdquo; Chief Minnemung
nodded his head in dismissal. &ldquo;That is all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Jim stumbled back; Wahbunou and his mother were
still working with the squirrel skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jim?&rdquo; Wahbunou asked, when he
caught sight of Jim&rsquo;s stricken face. &ldquo;Was Chief Minnemung
angry with you? And for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. &ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t angry. He wanted
to tell me that he is going to adopt me as his son in
the fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou dropped the skin he was cleaning. &ldquo;Chief
Minnemung is going to adopt you!&rdquo; Wahbunou clapped
Jim on the back. &ldquo;Why, that means you&rsquo;ll be the son of
a chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim hung his head and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Wahbunou,
I don&rsquo;t want to be adopted by Chief Minnemung. And
I don&rsquo;t want to be a member of your tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou stared at Jim, thinking he had not heard
him correctly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be Chief Minnemung&rsquo;s
son?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Now Jim&rsquo;s blue eyes were misty with tears. &ldquo;No, Wahbunou.
You and your people have been very kind to me,
but I want my own people. I hope to find my father and
mother. Don&rsquo;t you remember that you didn&rsquo;t want to live
with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou nodded slowly. &ldquo;But, Jim, you don&rsquo;t know
where your father and mother are. Nor do I. I only know
they were prisoners of the Shawnees. And they live far
to the east. We Potawatomis do not mingle with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s lips trembled as he said, &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re still alive, I&rsquo;ll
find them some day, Wahbunou. I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy
being a real Potawatomi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou sighed and was silent for a while. Finally
he said, &ldquo;Jim, I do understand that you want to be with
your own people. Believe me. But Chief Minnemung
has spoken. His word is law with us. There is nothing
that my father or I can do to prevent your adoption.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<div class="img">

<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LONG-KNIVES</span></h2>
<p>Several days later Chief Minnemung sent word around
that everyone was to prepare for the annual trading trip
to Cahokia. Soon the women were busy sorting the fur
pelts they had accumulated during the winter and spring,
and tying them in separate bundles according to kind.
When all were sorted, Jim was surprised to see how many
bundles there were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Cahokia, Wahbunou? What is it?&rdquo; Jim asked.
He and Wahbunou were mounted on the horse ready to
start on the journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Wahbunou smiled. &ldquo;Cahokia is a French village a long
way from here. We go there every year about this time.
The French have a trading post and we&rsquo;ll trade our furs
for many supplies which we need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What supplies, Wahbunou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what we&rsquo;ll get this trip, but sometimes
we get food or blankets. I think Chief Minnemung may
want to trade for guns and some powder. The French
are our friends; we always stay a while in their village.
Then we&rsquo;ll move on for the annual council of our tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow crossed Jim&rsquo;s face at mention of the council,
because Minnemung had told him the adoption ceremonies
would take place there. Suddenly a plan of escape
from the Potawatomis occurred to him. Perhaps he
might be able to join the French while trading was going
on; they might even help him find his parents. But he
said nothing to Wahbunou.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The Potawatomis had been wandering southeast, but
now they turned about and began riding in a westerly direction,
bearing a little to the north. It was so warm they
didn&rsquo;t try to cover many miles in a day. Sometimes they
stayed several days in their overnight camps. This was
the season for ripe berries, so the Indians stopped often to
feast on wild raspberries or dewberries.</p>
<p>One afternoon they happened upon a large berry patch
bordering a heavy forest. Everyone ate his fill of berries
while the women and children gathered some in their
kettles and gourds to take with them. Wahbunou told
Jim they would be leaving the forests now and riding
through wide meadows of prairie grass. There would not
be another opportunity to pick berries this summer.</p>
<p>The two boys tethered their horse, scrambling farther
and farther into the brambles away from the rest of the
Indians and seeking larger and larger berries. All at once
Jim looked back and saw the Potawatomis riding away
without them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wahbunou!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look! Minnemung and the
rest are leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Wahbunou glanced toward the disappearing group.
&ldquo;In a minute, Jim. We can catch them easily. Let&rsquo;s get
just a few more berries.&rdquo; He pointed to a heavily laden
bush nearby. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get those, then we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim glanced uneasily at the band of Indians now almost
out of sight in the tall prairie grass. He didn&rsquo;t want to be
left in this trackless ocean of grass. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go, Wahbunou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou tossed his head and laughed. &ldquo;I can catch
them easily, Jim. My horse isn&rsquo;t far away and he&rsquo;s faster
than any save Chief Minnemung&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Then he turned
again to the berries. The boys had been stuffing themselves
with the delicious fruit for perhaps ten minutes,
when Wahbunou&rsquo;s horse suddenly began pawing the
ground. Wahbunou cocked his head to one side and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the sound of many feet, Jim. I think it&rsquo;s the
feet of many men.&rdquo; Now it was Wahbunou&rsquo;s turn to be
alarmed.</p>
<p>Jim frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear anything, Wahbunou.
Let&rsquo;s be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wait,&rdquo; cautioned Wahbunou, seizing his horse&rsquo;s
bridle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear any horses&rsquo; hoofs, just the sound of
men.&rdquo; He led his horse to the edge of the berry patch,
where he could see the broad expanse of prairie. The
grass was almost as tall as Jim&rsquo;s head, it rippled rhythmically
in the wind, making it look like waves of the ocean.
It had a sort of singing sound which Jim had never heard
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear only a sort of singing,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
the wind in this grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou put his finger to his lips. &ldquo;Shh, Jim!
They&rsquo;re coming.&rdquo; Then he signaled to his horse to lie
down at the edge of the grass.</p>
<p>The horse obeyed immediately and none too soon
either. The next moment the boys saw a band of white
men marching out of the forest. And they kept coming,
more men than Wahbunou could count. Just before they
plunged into the thick prairie grass the boys could see they
had long rifles and wore sparkling long knives in their
belts. The sun shining on the knives made them visible
even at this distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Shemolsea!</i>&rdquo; gasped Wahbunou, dropping to his
knees.</p>
<p>Jim also dropped down into the grass and turned to
Wahbunou. &ldquo;Wahbunou,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;what do you
mean by <i>Shemolsea</i>? I remember you said that word the
day my father found you in the woods. And Chief Minnemung
said his rifle was <i>Shemolsea</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou whispered, &ldquo;<i>Shemolsea</i>&mdash;Long-Knife.
Men who carry long knives. You know your father had
one. He is <i>Shemolsea</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You mean all of us Kentucky settlers are Long-Knives?&rdquo;
Jim started to stand up, but Wahbunou pulled
him down. &ldquo;Do you want them to kill you, Jim?&rdquo; he
whispered in terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they wouldn&rsquo;t kill us. Maybe I might know
some of them.&rdquo; Jim raised up to take another look at the
men. Their column had turned southwest and Jim could
no longer see their faces. There were so many men Jim
was afraid to call out to them. &ldquo;I wonder who they are
and where they&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; he muttered, half to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Wahbunou was whispering, &ldquo;As soon as they&rsquo;ve gone,
we&rsquo;ll have to ride fast and tell Chief Minnemung about
the many, many Long-Knives we&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go and join them,&rdquo; Jim cried, scrambling
up from the tall grass.</p>
<p>Wahbunou tripped him and he fell headlong. &ldquo;No,
Jim. That you cannot do. Chief Minnemung would kill
me if anything happened to you. You must ride back
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou looked so frightened that Jim hesitated. He
wouldn&rsquo;t want Wahbunou punished by Chief Minnemung;
nor would he want those Long-Knives, whoever
they were, to attack the little Potawatomi band. For
a few minutes he was silent. Then he said, &ldquo;Wahbunou,
I&rsquo;ll go back with you, if you&rsquo;ll promise not to tell
anyone we saw these Long-Knives. Promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But maybe they&rsquo;ll attack us,&rdquo; Wahbunou replied
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, those men aren&rsquo;t marching after a small band of
Indians,&rdquo; Jim replied. &ldquo;Is there any town near here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kaskaskia is over that way.&rdquo; Wahbunou pointed in
the general direction the column of men had taken. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
another French settlement. We do not go through it on
the way to Cahokia. Cahokia is north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. He still wondered where those
Long-Knives were going&mdash;his Long-Knives. Why, they
were his people! Suddenly he thought of another plan of
escape, this time without involving Wahbunou. Here
was his real chance. He turned to tell the Indian boy,
but Wahbunou was on his feet signaling to his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Jim. The Long-Knives have gone. I think
we can ride now.&rdquo; Wahbunou mounted his horse and
Jim climbed on behind him.</p>
<p>As they rode through the prairie grass away from the
column of Long-Knives, Jim said, &ldquo;Wahbunou, I can&rsquo;t
go through with it. I can&rsquo;t let Chief Minnemung adopt
me into the Potawatomi tribe. My countrymen are close
at hand. I can join these white Long-Knives and perhaps
they will know something of my father and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Wahbunou trembled as he cried out, &ldquo;Jim! You must
not leave me. You must go back to Chief Minnemung.
He will kill me if I return without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim became thoughtful; then he said, &ldquo;Wahbunou, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be your fault if I left the camp tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou gulped. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare do that, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I? You did. You stole away
from us and went back to your people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian boy urged his horse to a faster pace. &ldquo;Yes,
Jim, I did. My people were going to a place I knew and I
had a horse. You wouldn&rsquo;t take my horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Wahbunou, I wouldn&rsquo;t steal your horse. But you
must promise not to tell anyone about seeing the Long-Knives.
I&rsquo;ll steal away at night. I&rsquo;ll find those men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jim, you&rsquo;d get lost in the dark. And Chief Minnemung
would hear you. Indians have sharp ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the stars to guide me. My father taught me
to tell direction by the stars. The Long-Knives certainly
won&rsquo;t march all night. I&rsquo;ll find them, never fear.&rdquo; Jim
clutched Wahbunou more firmly. &ldquo;Now promise me&mdash;no
word about the Long-Knives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Wahbunou gulped and finally said, &ldquo;It shall be as you
say. Wahbunou will say no word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the two boys made a solemn pact riding back to
the Potawatomi band.</p>
<p>When they finally arrived, the Indians had pitched
camp in a small thicket adjoining the prairie. It was almost
dark and the women had supper ready. Strangely
enough no one had missed them, so the boys didn&rsquo;t have
to explain their absence. Evidently the Indians had
neither heard nor seen the marching column of men, because
they seemed as carefree as usual.</p>
<p>After supper, as the Indians sat around the campfire,
Chief Minnemung suddenly took a notion to have Jim
play his drum. &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get your drum and play
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Nothing could have pleased Jim more. If his Long-Knives
were within hearing distance and heard the roll
of the drum, they might investigate the sound. He didn&rsquo;t
want to see his Indian friends hurt, but he did wish the
Long-Knives would appear and take him with them. He
rose quickly. &ldquo;Yes, Chief Minnemung, I&rsquo;ll be glad to
play for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou&rsquo;s mother had to unpack the drum from her
housekeeping belongings, but she did not protest because
Chief Minnemung had ordered Jim to play.</p>
<p>Jim beat the drum with all his might, executing some
long rolls and difficult ruffles. Now and then he would
toss a drumstick into the air and catch it again without
missing a beat. At this the Indians grinned in glee at his
skill.</p>
<p>Jim played until he was exhausted, all the while hoping
to see the Long-Knives coming to the camp. But no one
came, and nothing broke the stillness of the summer
night save the beating of his drum.</p>
<p>At last Chief Minnemung signaled for him to stop playing.
Immediately all the Indians lay down to sleep.
Wahbunou&rsquo;s mother forgot to pack Jim&rsquo;s drum away, so
he put it carefully down on the ground between him and
Wahbunou. Then he lay down and pretended to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>He listened for a long time until he felt sure everyone
was asleep; then he took his drum and began to crawl
slowly from his place on the ground. But Wahbunou
was not asleep. At Jim&rsquo;s first move he whispered, &ldquo;Jim,
are you leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim turned and patted Wahbunou&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Shh!
Yes. Thanks, Wahbunou. I&rsquo;ll never forget you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou sighed but did not reply, so Jim felt sure his
secret was safe with his Indian friend. Wahbunou would
not fail him.</p>
<p>He continued to inch along the ground with the drum,
stopping every few feet to see if any of the other Indians
had awakened; but save for Wahbunou, the camp was
silent.</p>
<p>When he was certain he was far enough away not to be
seen, Jim stood up; he fastened his drum and drumsticks
to the belt encircling his long blue shirt, and looked at the
sky. It was a beautiful summer night and the sky was
filled with stars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>He studied them for a few minutes until he located the
North Star and the Big Dipper. Then he began walking
southwest, the way the Long-Knives had marched in the
afternoon. Except for twinkling stars, the night was very
black, because there was no moon.</p>
<p>Jim trudged along and was soon beyond the little
thicket, which broke the vast prairie. All through the
long night, he made his way through the high prairie
grass, hearing no sound save the singing of the wind.</p>
<p>When morning finally came, he found himself in the
midst of a trackless ocean of grass, with no sign of any
Long-Knives, no telltale path through the grass or sign of
the Indians&rsquo; camp. There was only singing, swaying
prairie grass, stretching toward the horizon in all directions.</p>
<p>Jim sighed, but walked steadily on, now and then
scaring up a flock of prairie chickens which rose squawking
into the air. Taking his bearings from the sun now,
he knew he was going west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The sun grew unbearably hot, making Jim very thirsty,
but there was no water anywhere. Now and then he
would look back to see if the Indians could be pursuing
him. But he needn&rsquo;t have worried. His slight figure left
no trail through the prairie grass.</p>
<p>As the day wore on he became thirstier, and very hungry.
He began to wonder if he had made a mistake to
leave the Indians and try to find a band of strange men in
this trackless country. Late in the afternoon he thought
he saw a line of trees in the distance. He couldn&rsquo;t be sure,
because this steaming prairie grass played tricks with his
eyes and he was afraid he saw a mirage. If he could only
make it to those trees, he would lie down in the shade and
rest a bit.</p>
<p>The trees proved to be real enough, and when Jim
reached them he fell into their cool shade and fell asleep.</p>
<p>He was awakened after dawn by someone prodding
his foot and a rough voice saying, &ldquo;Get up, boy. Who are
you? Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim opened his eyes and saw two men standing over
him. They were dressed in dirty, torn buckskins, with
long knives hanging to their belts. The taller man was
prodding him with a rifle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Jim sprang up, his eyes shining. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re the
<i>Shemolsea</i>&mdash;the Long-Knives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind who we are,&rdquo; the man said crossly.
&ldquo;Who are you in that Indian outfit? What are you doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jim Hudson. I escaped from the Indians last
night and I&rsquo;ve been trying to find you all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A likely story,&rdquo; muttered the shorter man. &ldquo;Probably
you&rsquo;re some spy sent out by the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. &ldquo;No, sir. I saw a big band of
Long-Knives yesterday and I&rsquo;ve been trying to find
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take him to Colonel Clark,&rdquo; the shorter man
suggested.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Clark, did you say? George
Rogers Clark? Is he red-haired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall soldier spoke again. &ldquo;Say, boy, you know
too much. Come on, get going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>As they walked single file through the woods, they
made Jim walk between them. After stumbling over
fallen trees and brambles for about a mile, they came
upon a group of ragged men sitting and standing in
the dense shade along a river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Clark, sir,&rdquo; began the tall soldier, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
found a white boy; he says he was a prisoner of the Indians.
But he knows too much. Must be some trick here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ragged, commanding figure with red hair turned
from the men and walked over to Jim. His stern, hazel
eyes seemed to penetrate Jim&rsquo;s whole body as he said,
&ldquo;Well, lad, who are you? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was so excited he could scarcely talk. &ldquo;Colonel
Clark, I&rsquo;m Jim Hudson. I don&rsquo;t suppose you remember
me, sir, but I remember your red hair. I met you late last
year with my father at Coon Hollow. We had been hunting
and had bagged a deer. You advised my father to go
to Harrodsburg until the Indian scare was over.&rdquo; Jim
looked hopefully at the colonel.</p>
<p>Colonel Clark seemed to be turning something over in
his mind. Finally he smiled. &ldquo;I remember. But how do
you happen to be out here in the Illinois country?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Then Jim told the long story of how he and Pa and
Ma had been captured by the Shawnees on the way to
Harrodsburg; how later he had been traded to the
Potawatomis, with whom he had spent the winter. When
he was telling of seeing the column of Long-Knives,
Colonel Clark interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, boy. Did the Indians with you see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. &ldquo;No, sir, only Wahbunou. We
had stayed behind the rest to eat more berries. Wahbunou
promised me he would not tell he had seen the
Long-Knives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark looked puzzled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to believe,
Jim. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust an Indian not to warn his people of
an army of white men near them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall soldier scowled, as did several others. But no
one spoke a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; Jim replied, &ldquo;we saved Wahbunou&rsquo;s life, so
he promised not to tell about the Long-Knives. He knew
of my plan to escape.&rdquo; Jim explained how the Hudsons
found Wahbunou near their clearing and of Chief Minnemung&rsquo;s
decision to adopt Jim. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I ran away,
sir. I didn&rsquo;t want to be a Potawatomi. I hope to find my
parents, but I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Rogers Clark nodded. &ldquo;I trust they are, Jim,
and I can&rsquo;t blame you for not wanting to be a Potawatomi.
For the present you&rsquo;ll go with us and be a part of
my volunteer army. We&rsquo;re crossing the river tonight
and marching on Kaskaskia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have a drum. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll need a drummer
before this night is over.&rdquo; He turned and motioned
to the tall soldier. &ldquo;This is Simon Kenton, Jim. You are
to go with him and do whatever he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon Kenton inclined his head toward the river bank.
&ldquo;Come on, Jim. We&rsquo;ll have a look at Kaskaskia from
this side of the river. Have a care though. We don&rsquo;t want
any of those Frenchmen over there to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jim and Kenton approached the river&rsquo;s edge, Kenton
dropped to the ground. &ldquo;We have to crawl now, Jim,
so&rsquo;s we can see without being seen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>At the edge of the bank they could see the little town of
Kaskaskia. It lay in a kind of amphitheatre of woods and
bluffs. They could also see the fort with a stockade built
around it, the steeple of a church, and some thatched
roofs and stone houses shining in the afternoon sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;s bigger than the settlements I&rsquo;ve seen in Virginia!&rdquo;
Jim exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Kenton replied. &ldquo;This is one of the oldest and
best of the French villages. I&rsquo;ve heard it called the Paris of
the West. See that British flag flying above the fort? Tomorrow,
God willing, it&rsquo;ll be flying the American flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Jim, Colonel Clark has to take this country
from the British to make our Kentucky settlers safe
from Indian attack. Commander Hamilton at Detroit
has been stirring up the Indians against our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I know. I think that&rsquo;s how my parents and I
happened to be captured.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>For a while they watched the town. Nothing unusual
was going on, so Simon Kenton told Jim he thought no
one there suspected the presence of Clark and his army
directly across the river. Then they crawled back to the
main group of soldiers.</p>
<p>Jim didn&rsquo;t think the men in this motley, exhausted
army could capture a town during the night. Several of
them had taken off their shoes and were nursing their
painful, swollen feet. They were suffering from scald
foot, a wilderness malady brought on by dampness, heat
and too much marching.</p>
<p>Jim wondered if they could put on their shoes when it
came time to cross the river. All of them were hungry besides,
as they had eaten nothing but berries for many days.
Could such an army capture a well-fed town like Kaskaskia?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>

</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ON TO KASKASKIA</span></h2>
<p>When night fell, Colonel Clark ordered his men to
march. Led by two soldiers who had been scouting the
woods all afternoon, they followed the bank of the
Kaskaskia River until they came to a farmhouse. Here
several boats were moored at the river bank. Clark
ordered some of his men to surround the house and
others to seize the family living in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>A very frightened Frenchman, his wife and their several
children came out of the house, holding their hands
high in the air. The soldiers brought the father to Colonel
Clark who began questioning him about the town
of Kaskaskia.</p>
<p>The man said the town had been expecting an attack
from the direction of the Mississippi River. This alarm
had died down, he thought, because now there was no
extra militia at Kaskaskia. He also said most of the Indians
loitering there had left and gone to Cahokia.</p>
<p>Jim shivered at the mention of Cahokia and wondered
if Chief Minnemung and his Potawatomis had arrived
there, or if they were still searching for him.</p>
<p>When Clark got the information that the town was
quiet, he permitted the French family to return to their
home, and ordered his men to start ferrying the army
across the river. Since he had well over a hundred men,
they must make many trips back and forth in the few
boats on the river bank. Jim and Simon Kenton were to
go with the first group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>As Jim climbed into one boat, he stumbled over a boy
about his own age who was trembling and cowering in
the bottom. Kenton, just behind Jim, pointed his rifle at
the boy. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked gruffly. &ldquo;What are
you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frightened boy did not reply but stared up at the
rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, boy,&rdquo; Kenton repeated, &ldquo;what are you doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy scrambled to his feet and stammered, &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;I
was just going home. I came from Kaskaskia this
morning in this boat. I was hunting beeswax for Father
Gibault. He needs more beeswax for the church candles.
When I saw all your men I hid here. I hoped you would
go away so I could go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kenton sneered. &ldquo;A likely story. You&rsquo;ve been spying
for de Rochblave no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir. I only know the commandant by sight,
sir. I tell you true, I was hunting beeswax. And I found a
bee tree, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll go back as our prisoner. Sit down in the
boat.&rdquo; Simon Kenton turned to Jim. &ldquo;Sit beside him,
Jim, and keep your eye on him. Don&rsquo;t let him get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jim replied, making room for the boy.</p>
<p>The boat was now filled and the men began rowing
across the river toward Kaskaskia. Jim could feel the
boy trembling beside him. He whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
afraid. Colonel Clark will see that no harm comes to you.
What&rsquo;s your name? I&rsquo;m Jim Hudson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie&mdash;&mdash;Willie Watson,&rdquo; the boy replied.</p>
<p>As soon as all soldiers were ferried across the river and
assembled in their respective companies, Colonel Clark
stepped out in front of them. It was too dark to see this
erect, commanding man, but there was no mistaking the
stern authority in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our first objective is to take this town.
By seizing Kaskaskia, we&rsquo;ll be protecting our countrymen
in the western country. You all know the British have
been inciting the Indians to war against our settlers. By
controlling this French settlement, we&rsquo;ll cut off all supplies
from New Orleans and the west to Hamilton at
Detroit, so tonight it&rsquo;s win or lose everything. Now,
I&rsquo;ll make three divisions of these companies. Captain
Bowman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and Captain Bowman stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to command one division. Take your men to
the far quarter of the town. Captain Helm, command the
second, and take your men to the other end of town. I&rsquo;ll
lead the third division.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men assembled quickly according to orders.
Jim and Willie were assigned to Captain Bowman&rsquo;s division.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kenton,&rdquo; Colonel Clark continued, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re to go
with me. Now, men, if we take the fort and capture de
Rochblave without resistance, you&rsquo;ll hear three shots.
The shots will be my signal of victory. Then all of you
are to yell and shout as loudly as you can. And Jim,&rdquo;
Colonel Clark peered into the darkness, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Jim
Hudson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the men start yelling, you beat your drum as
hard as possible. Run through the town from one end to
the other beating it. That will help make the French
think we have a large army. Keep beating it. Do you
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of you men speak French, step forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several soldiers stepped forward from the ranks.</p>
<p>Willie whispered to Jim, &ldquo;I can speak French, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step forward then,&rdquo; Jim urged, so Willie stepped out
with the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I give the signal,&rdquo; Clark continued, &ldquo;you are to
run through the streets telling the people in French that
the Long-Knives have taken Kaskaskia. And tell them
to stay inside their homes. If they venture outside they
will be shot.&rdquo; Clark&rsquo;s voice became sterner than before.
&ldquo;Now then, not one of you is to talk to any of the inhabitants.
I want no conversation with them. Is that
clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the men answered in chorus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Immediately Colonel Clark set out, leading his own
division through dark, silent streets toward the fort. The
two captains started with their men for the assigned positions.
For Jim and Willie it was an eerie experience to
march through the dark streets, then wait&mdash;wait in silence
for the hoped-for signal.</p>
<p>After what seemed an endless time to the boys, three
rifle shots rang out from the fort. These meant that
Colonel Clark and his men had captured Commandant
Philip de Rochblave and his fort without any resistance.</p>
<p>Then what yelling and screaming went up in all parts
of the town. Those men speaking French tried to out-yell
other Long-Knives shouting Clark&rsquo;s orders in English.
As Willie ran through the streets shouting his orders,
Jim kept beside him, beating his drum with all his
might.</p>
<p>Jim thought he&rsquo;d better keep track of Willie so he
wouldn&rsquo;t escape. Willie, however, showed no signs of
wanting to leave the Long-Knives, but kept shouting
Clark&rsquo;s orders over and over. They kept up this din all
night and were so excited they never thought of sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="1032" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The next morning the streets were deserted save for
Clark&rsquo;s troops now doing guard duty in various parts of
town. Jim and Willie were still together and Jim was surprised
to see what a beautiful place Kaskaskia was.</p>
<p>In the center of town was a large grass-covered square,
with narrow streets leading out from it. From here Jim
saw the American flag was indeed flying from the old fort.
There were a few stone houses here and there, but most
of them were wooden with pointed, thatched roofs and
chimneys at either end.</p>
<p>While Jim was admiring the town, someone called,
&ldquo;Come on, boys. Breakfast is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim and Willie didn&rsquo;t need to be called the second time.
They dashed to join the men just sitting down to breakfast;
it had been prepared by spies Colonel Clark had sent
into town ahead of his troops.</p>
<p>Meantime the terror-stricken residents of Kaskaskia
remained indoors, not knowing what was to become of
them. Father Pierre Gibault asked Colonel Clark if the
people could assemble in the church to pray. They feared
they were to be separated and taken away by Clark&rsquo;s
soldiers. Clark granted Father Gibault&rsquo;s request and the
people walked solemnly into the church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Some time later Colonel Clark spoke to them, telling
them not to be afraid. He said the king of France had
joined the Americans against the British and now they
could all work together. He asked only that the residents
of Kaskaskia swear allegiance to the Long-Knives, who
represented the Continental Congress and Virginia.</p>
<p>Immediately the gloom and fear of the people melted
away. They rang the old church bell in jubilation, giving
thanks for their freedom, weeping and laughing for joy.</p>
<p>No one was more astounded at this news than little
Willie Watson. He clapped his hands and turned handsprings
down the street. He had expected to be thrown
into chains and taken far away. Now he was as free as
Jim. He looked at his friend. &ldquo;Colonel Clark is a wonderful
man,&rdquo; he said, his dark eyes shining.</p>
<p>Jim nodded. &ldquo;Willie, were you really hunting beeswax
across the river?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I was, Jim. We have no wax for the church
candles, so I went to hunt a bee tree. Now I&rsquo;ll get someone
to go with me to get the honey and wax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you responsible for the candles, Willie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely, Jim. I am a ward of Father Gibault and
I help him in any way I can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was a river man on the Ohio. He worked
for Boynton, Wharton and Morgan Company. They
used to send boatloads of merchandise from Philadelphia
down the Ohio and up the Mississippi Rivers to their
store here. My father made many trips for them, but he
was drowned in 1772. So Father Gibault found a house
for my mother and me next door to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you live with your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. She sews for some of the wealthy people
and mends for Father Gibault. In the winter I work for
Monsieur Gabriel Cerr&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s face was sad for a moment. &ldquo;My mother was a
good seamstress, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie was puzzled. &ldquo;Say, where are your mother and
father? How do you happen to be with Clark&rsquo;s army?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Then Jim told Willie about the last time he had seen
his parents and what had happened to him since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad, Jim,&rdquo; Willie said. &ldquo;Of course Indians
do sometimes kill their prisoners, but it&rsquo;s likely your
parents are still alive. What are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim sighed. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll find them some day. Maybe
Colonel Clark will have a job for me. I&rsquo;d like to stay with
him and his men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie smiled. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t, Jim, I think I can get you
a job working with me. Monsieur Cerr&eacute; is a big merchant
here and needs quite a few people in the fall. He&rsquo;s
away from Kaskaskia right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded. &ldquo;I may ask you later, Willie, because I
have to find something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;d better go home now, Jim. Will you come
home with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks, Willie. I have to see what Colonel Clark
has in mind for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, for now,&rdquo; and Willie ran happily
down the street toward Father Gibault&rsquo;s house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Jim walked slowly over to Colonel Clark&rsquo;s headquarters.
When he arrived Captain Bowman and a few
French citizens were just leaving. Clark was giving them
last-minute instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Bowman,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;use all your persuasive
powers and those of these good citizens,&rdquo; he
nodded toward the Frenchmen, &ldquo;to get the people of
Cahokia to swear allegiance to our Continental Congress.
No violence, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Captain Bowman replied, saluting smartly.
&ldquo;I think I can win them over with the help of these men.&rdquo;
Then he and the Frenchmen left headquarters for their
ride to Cahokia.</p>
<p>After they had gone Colonel Clark noticed Jim standing
in the room. &ldquo;Hello, Jim. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder, sir,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;if you have a job for me.
You see I have no home here, as Willie has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark frowned for a moment and then smiled.
&ldquo;To be sure, I have a job for you, Jim. You can be my
personal messenger. Now that we have won Kaskaskia,
I have to deal with the Indian tribes camped in this neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a good penman, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can write a good hand, sir. My mother used to be a
governess in Virginia and she taught me to read, write
and figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I have a lot of letters to write and you can help
me with them, too. You&rsquo;ll sleep here at headquarters and
eat with my men. Tomorrow you&rsquo;ll have plenty of work
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, sir.&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s heart was singing. All
would be well with him if he could stay with Colonel
Clark.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">NO ADOPTION</span></h2>
<p>George Rogers Clark&rsquo;s sudden appearance in the
French settlements with his army threw the Indians
camping there into a panic. They thought the army
larger than it was and expected to be attacked momentarily.
Some tribes asked their French friends in Kaskaskia
and Cahokia what they should do.</p>
<p>The French, who were now firm friends of the Long-Knives,
advised them to call upon Clark and sue for
peace. Then these same Frenchmen reported to Clark
that the Indians had come to them for advice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Colonel Clark was quick to take advantage of the Indians&rsquo;
confusion. He prepared a letter to be sent to the
tribes, telling them to lay down their tomahawks and
ally themselves with him, or to fight like men for the
English. Jim Hudson made several copies of this letter,
which Clark sent by him and other messengers to the different
tribes.</p>
<p>The Kickapoos and Piankeshaws signed treaties immediately
with the Long-Knives. Other tribes, however&mdash;&mdash;the
Chippewas, Ottawas, Potawatomis, Sacs and
Foxes&mdash;&mdash;came into Cahokia and demanded a council
with Clark. They wanted to see the chief Long-Knife
and to hear what he had to say.</p>
<p>Colonel Clark sent word to them that he would attend
their council, but he took his time about going to Cahokia
to meet with them. He thought it would be well for the
Indians to wait on him. After a while he took Jim Hudson,
some of his officers and many of his soldiers to Cahokia,
which had sworn allegiance to him through Captain
Bowman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Clark&rsquo;s new headquarters were in a house beside the
Cahokia River. In a few days a band of Winnebagos,
often called Stinkers by the French, pitched camp in a
Frenchman&rsquo;s yard, just across the road from Clark&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>
<p>When Jim Hudson saw the Indians he was frightened
and said to Colonel Clark, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think those Stinkers
should camp so near you, sir. They might attack us. We
don&rsquo;t have many soldiers here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;How right you are, Jim.
I think they have something like that in mind. Perhaps
they want to kidnap me so I can&rsquo;t appear at the council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shivered. &ldquo;Oh, sir! Can&rsquo;t you recall some of the
men you have stationed around the town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, you have the mark of a military man,&rdquo; Colonel
Clark replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I intend to do, but I don&rsquo;t
want these Stinkers to know about my reinforcements.
You go to my captains now and tell them to send several
guard details to my headquarters as soon as it is dark.
Tell them to come in one by one at the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jim replied, glad to have an errand and to
know they were to have more soldiers at headquarters.
He dashed out to find Captain Helm and Simon Kenton.</p>
<p>That evening fifty guards began filtering into headquarters,
some to conceal themselves in the house, others
to stand in the darkness outside. Although Clark walked
alone about the yard, nothing happened.</p>
<p>The next night the guards again took up their same stations.
Colonel Clark stayed up late, supposedly working
on reports.</p>
<p>Jim couldn&rsquo;t sleep, so he went to the window and
stared out into the night. About one o&rsquo;clock shots were
fired across the river. In a few minutes Jim saw some
skulking figures in the headquarters yard. He wanted to
scream, but Clark himself gave the alarm.</p>
<p>Immediately the guards appeared from all sides of the
building. They succeeded in capturing three of the Stinkers
and hustled them into headquarters. The shots and
ensuing racket awakened the town; some of the citizens
hurried to headquarters to see what was the matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>To Jim&rsquo;s great surprise, the colonel asked these Frenchmen
what punishment they thought these Stinkers deserved.
In one voice they said these Indians should be
put in irons. Then and there, Clark made this an order.
Thus he maneuvered so that the French suggested the
punishment for the Indians.</p>
<p>The next morning Colonel Clark went to the great Indian
council, accompanied by some of his officers and
townsmen. At the last minute he told Jim he might go.
He also had the three Stinkers brought to the council in
chains. How ridiculous they looked clanking along beside
the officers.</p>
<p>Jim was amazed at the number of Indians awaiting
Colonel Clark&rsquo;s arrival. Jim looked over the crowd to see
if he could see Chief Minnemung or any of his Potawatomis.
If they were there he could not locate them in the
vast throng.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>He glanced at his colonel, wondering if he were not
frightened among so many Indians. But Clark looked as
if he were master of the entire council. Fear was not a
part of George Rogers Clark&rsquo;s character; and since the
Indians had asked him to come to the council, he waited
for them to speak.</p>
<p>After a few minutes a tall, erect, haughty chief, dressed
in a handsome buffalo robe, came forward to stand directly
in front of Colonel Clark. &ldquo;Chief Long-Knife,&rdquo; he
began, &ldquo;we hope the Great Spirit has brought us together
for good and that we may be received as friends. The bad
bird British ordered us to attack your countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and motioned for one of his tribesmen to
bring something to him. When the Indian brought him a
bloody belt, some red wampum and two British flags,
the chief threw them to the floor and stomped upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have received these emblems of war from the bad
bird British and now we hope peace with you will take
the place of the bloody belt of war.&rdquo; Then the chief
walked back to his people. Other chiefs came up asking
for peace. Even the Winnebagos came up and offered
the peace pipe to Colonel Clark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>He waved them away, however, because he knew it
was best to keep the Winnebagos in suspense for a while
about the fate of their Stinker relatives still in chains.
Then he told all chiefs who had made speeches that he
would consider their offer and give them an answer the
next day. He left the council with his staff, and all the
townspeople and Jim.</p>
<p>The next morning after the council fires were kindled
anew, George Rogers Clark gave his answer to the waiting
Indians. He told them why the Long-Knives were at
war with the British, and that the British had become so
weak they were forced to hire Indians to fight for them.
He also told them the French king, father of all their
French friends, had also joined the Long-Knives against
the British.</p>
<p>Finally he said, &ldquo;Now you can judge who is right, the
Long-Knives or the British. Here is the bloody belt of
war, here the white belt of peace. Take the one you
please. Behave like men though, and choose the one you
wish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="1093" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want you to give me an answer until you have
time to counsel. We will part, and when you are ready, if
the Great Spirit will bring us together again, let us prove
ourselves worthy by speaking and thinking with one
heart and one tongue.&rdquo; Then Colonel Clark and his
group left the council, not returning until the Indians sent
for him.</p>
<p>They had assembled with their peace pipes, and many
chiefs made flowery speeches about their intended friendship
with the Long-Knives. Later they smoked their
peace pipes and offered them to Clark, who went through
the pipe-smoking ceremony with them.</p>
<p>Jim Hudson knew Indians did not always keep their
word; how he hoped Colonel Clark knew it, too.</p>
<p>These council meetings went on for days until Jim
grew weary of attending them. One morning, however,
he was surprised to see two stalwart young Winnebagos
present themselves in front of Colonel Clark, then fall to
the ground and cover themselves with a blanket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Jim did not know what to make of this and looked
questioningly at the colonel. George Rogers Clark&rsquo;s face
did not change expression as he waited to see what would
happen next.</p>
<p>One of the Winnebago chiefs stepped forward; he explained
that these two young men were offering themselves
as a sacrifice to atone for what their Winnebago
relatives had done at Clark&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>
<p>Colonel Clark did not reply at once, but kept staring at
the blanket covering the two men. Jim and the rest
waited anxiously, expecting the colonel to order the Winnebagos
killed immediately, or at least to be cast into
irons.</p>
<p>To everyone&rsquo;s amazement, Colonel Clark rose and ordered
the two Indians to stand. Then he took each of
them by the hand as brothers and introduced them to his
officers and the Frenchmen sitting with his group. A loud
murmur of approval arose from the surprised Indians.
Still more surprising to Jim was Clark&rsquo;s order to free the
Stinkers who had tried to kidnap him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>All during these meetings Jim had looked in vain for
the Potawatomis with whom he had spent the winter; he
wondered if they had ever arrived in Cahokia. The day
after Clark had freed the Stinkers, Jim discovered Chief
Minnemung and his clan sitting near the front of the assembly.
For a moment he was afraid&mdash;would these Potawatomis
try to capture him again? Then he glanced at
Colonel Clark and realized he was safe where he was.</p>
<p>At this council meeting Big Gate, one of the great Potawatomi
chiefs, spoke for the entire tribe, saying they were
ready to sign a peace treaty with the Long-Knives. When
the treaty was signed, Colonel Clark and his staff rose to
leave. Suddenly Chief Minnemung barred his path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Long-Knife, chief of all the Long-Knives,&rdquo; Minnemung
began, nodding toward Jim, &ldquo;this boy ran away
from our clan. I planned to adopt him as my own son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim began to tremble when Colonel Clark turned to
him, all the while pretending he had never known of
Minnemung&rsquo;s plan. &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;is this true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jim stammered, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Chief Minnemung gestured impatiently, as he interrupted
Jim. &ldquo;Big Long-Knife, I say Chief Minnemung
no longer wants to adopt this boy. He not make good
Potawatomi. He is Jim Long-Knife. Chief Minnemung
is no longer interested in him. He now belongs to Big
Long-Knife Clark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim sighed in relief as Clark said gravely, &ldquo;So be it,
Chief Minnemung. I accept this boy as Jim Long-Knife.&rdquo;
He extended his hand to the Potawatomi chief
to seal their bargain.</p>
<p>Chief Minnemung shook hands with Clark without
glancing at Jim. Then he walked proudly to his clan.</p>
<p>George Rogers Clark could be stern no longer. As he
looked at Jim for a moment, his hazel eyes twinkled in
fun. &ldquo;I guess this makes you safe, Jim. You are now under
my control and a real Long-Knife. Chief Minnemung
has decreed it. Jim Long-Knife. That&rsquo;s a fine
name for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim smiled. &ldquo;Oh, sir, thank you. I&rsquo;m so glad Chief
Minnemung doesn&rsquo;t want me. I saw him sitting with the
other Indians today, and I was afraid he might have his
men take me prisoner again sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>

</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A PEACEFUL INTERVAL</span></h2>
<p>While Clark was counseling and making treaties with
the different Indian tribes at Cahokia, he was also sending
men on different missions throughout the western
country.</p>
<p>For the most important mission he chose Father Gibault
and Dr. Laffont, an influential citizen of Kaskaskia.
They were to take a proclamation to the French settlers at
Vincennes, asking them to renounce their fidelity to the
British king, George III and swear allegiance to the
Americans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Since Father Gibault was well known and respected
for his earlier good works among the people there and
Dr. Laffont was a most persuasive man, the French settlers
willingly took their oath of allegiance to the Americans.</p>
<p>Both men returned to Colonel Clark with this good
news long before his negotiations with the Indians were
completed. Then Clark dispatched Captain Helm to
take charge of Fort Sackville at Vincennes.</p>
<p>Now that the three French villages, Kaskaskia, Cahokia
and Vincennes were in American hands, about half
of Clark&rsquo;s volunteers returned to their homes in Kentucky
and Virginia. Those who stayed acted not only as
guards for the American headquarters, but reinforced
the French garrisons at Kaskaskia and Cahokia against
possible Indian attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Jim didn&rsquo;t know how to occupy his time, now that
Colonel Clark didn&rsquo;t seem to need him. One evening
he decided to ask the colonel about it. &ldquo;I have nothing to
do here, Colonel Clark,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I could go back to
Kentucky to see what&rsquo;s left of our farm. I wouldn&rsquo;t be
afraid to stay there alone, sir, and I could start clearing
more land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark fidgeted in his chair. &ldquo;I know you
aren&rsquo;t afraid, Jim, but I wouldn&rsquo;t think of letting you go
back alone. You&rsquo;d be a perfect target for Indians. They
haven&rsquo;t all signed treaties, remember. Even so, I don&rsquo;t
trust these redskins too far. Now if your parents&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; Jim interrupted, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if my parents&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, lad. It&rsquo;ll be time enough for you to go back
to your farm when we locate your father and mother. I
have asked every man who has gone out from here to be
on the lookout for the Hudsons. They are to ask in every
settlement if any one has seen or heard of them. It&rsquo;s a
slow sort of grapevine method, I know, but word gets
around that way. We&rsquo;ll find them, Jim, some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s blue eyes misted with tears. &ldquo;Oh, Colonel Clark,
you think of everything. No wonder you&rsquo;re such a good
military leader.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can stay on at headquarters with me, Jim. That
will give you a roof over your head and three meals a
day.&rdquo; He stared at Jim for a moment and then grinned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to find a buckskin outfit for you too, lad. Even
if you are Jim Long-Knife, that ragged blue outfit you&rsquo;re
wearing must be replaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim laughed. &ldquo;These are the clothes the Potawatomis
gave me. I have no others. The Shawnees took the ones
my mother was taking to Harrodsburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll need some work to do, Jim, to keep you
out of mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get a job, I&rsquo;m sure. Willie told me he could get
work for me with Monsieur Gabriel Cerr&eacute;, the wealthy
merchant here. Willie works for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark frowned. &ldquo;Willie? Who&rsquo;s Willie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim seemed surprised. &ldquo;Willie Watson, sir. The boy
we found in the boat the night we took Kaskaskia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clark nodded. &ldquo;To be sure. I remember you told me
about him, but I didn&rsquo;t notice him that night. What does
he do for Monsieur Cerr&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;He sorts fur pelts and counts them. I saw him yesterday
and he has already started the fall work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a good job, Jim. Ask Willie to take you
to see Monsieur Cerr&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;ll go over now and see Willie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim started over to the fur depot to find Willie, but on
the way he saw him coming. &ldquo;Oh, Willie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jim. Still running errands for Colonel Clark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I guess my work with him is over. I was just
coming to see if you could get me a job with Monsieur
Cerr&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie smiled. &ldquo;Sure. Just today the men were saying
they needed another boy to sort pelts this fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we go tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie shook his head. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t going to be any
work tomorrow. The men have to wait for some supplies
coming up from New Orleans. I&rsquo;ll be glad to take you as
soon as the depot opens again. I&rsquo;ve just been talking to
Father Gibault about getting the beeswax and honey
from that bee tree I marked for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been across the river since that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You see Father Gibault thought it would be easier
to get later in the fall. But since there&rsquo;s no work tomorrow
he said I might go after it, if I could get someone
to help me. Would you like to go along with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Sure, if Colonel Clark says I
may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over about ten o&rsquo;clock then. We can&rsquo;t go too
early as we have to wait until most of the bees are out of
the hive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there, Willie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to wear your moccasins&mdash;&rdquo; Willie looked
doubtfully at Jim&rsquo;s thin, worn clothes, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;d better
get some buckskin clothes to wear. Bees can&rsquo;t sting
through buckskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. See you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark said Jim might go after the honey, but
added he couldn&rsquo;t go unless they found some buckskin
clothes for him to wear. He hunted through some of the
supplies at headquarters and found a buckskin outfit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>When Jim arrived at Willie&rsquo;s house, Willie was ready
and waiting for him. He handed Jim one large wooden
bucket and carried another himself. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put the honey
and wax in these buckets,&rdquo; Willie explained. Then he
picked up a gaily colored cloth bundle.</p>
<p>The two boys put out in one of Father Gibault&rsquo;s boats
and soon crossed the Kaskaskia River, landing near the
house which Clark had surrounded the night he made
his march on Kaskaskia.</p>
<p>Willie moored the boat to a tree along the bank. Then
they started out to find the tree Willie had marked with
Father Gibault&rsquo;s initials. They wandered quite a way before
Willie suddenly cried, &ldquo;See, Jim, there it is!&rdquo; He
pointed to a tree with a large fork high above the ground.</p>
<p>Jim also saw the initials F. G. on the trunk; these
Willie had carved the day the Long-Knives had found
him in the boat. &ldquo;Why did you put Father Gibault&rsquo;s initials
there, Willie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to show the honey belonged to Father Gibault.
No one will steal honey from a marked tree,&rdquo; Willie explained
as he untied his cloth bundle. Out tumbled two
blue <i>capots</i> or cloaks with hoods, two small scarfs and
two pairs of mittens. Then he took out a long, sharp
knife from the pocket of one of the <i>capots</i>. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll
get dressed to tackle the bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim picked up the larger <i>capot</i> and tried it on. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
wear this, Willie. It&rsquo;s too small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie had already put on his <i>capot</i> and adjusted its
hood over his head. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t? Say, you&rsquo;re bigger than
I thought. That&rsquo;s my mother&rsquo;s <i>capot</i>, but I guess you
need a man-sized one. Just put the hood over your head
and let the cloak fly,&rdquo; he suggested as he tied a scarf over
his face.</p>
<p>Jim looked at the <i>capot</i> dubiously. &ldquo;Why are we wearing
all this stuff anyway, Willie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To keep the bees from stinging us, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll smother, Willie, and we can&rsquo;t see with the scarfs
over our faces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Willie nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m a stupid ox not to
think of that. Well, I&rsquo;ll fix it.&rdquo; He picked up the knife
and cut two slits in each scarf. &ldquo;Now we have peepholes.
Put one on, and the mittens too, Jim. If the bees are in a
bad mood, they can&rsquo;t sting us through the buckskin and
these winter clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim put them on and then asked, &ldquo;Now what do
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb up and start cutting the honey and wax
away. It&rsquo;s up there in a deep hole in the fork of the tree.
You put your bucket at the base of the tree and I&rsquo;ll try to
drop the honey and wax into it. This is a beautiful day,
so maybe most of the bees will be gone from their hive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim watched as Willie climbed the tree. What a ridiculous
sight he was, with the blue <i>capot</i> flapping against his
skinny legs.</p>
<p>Willie thrust the long knife into the hole and began
turning it slowly around and around. Only a few bees
emerged and buzzed around his blue hood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix the bucket, Jim,&rdquo; Willie called as the honey began
oozing down the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Jim put his bucket under the tree and began slapping
at a few bees that were buzzing all around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fight them, Jim. It makes them angry. Just let
them buzz and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll sting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon Willie had rolled out so much honey and beeswax
that his bucket would not hold it all. When both buckets
were filled, Willie came down from the tree. &ldquo;Now you
carry one and I&rsquo;ll carry the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite a bit of honey had trickled down the tree, so the
bees stayed behind, instead of following Willie and Jim.</p>
<p>As the boys walked back through the woods, Willie
looked admiringly at Jim. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re so
much larger than I am,&rdquo; Willie said. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re as
tall as lots of men. How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim smiled. &ldquo;I guess I grew a lot while I was with the
Potawatomis. I&rsquo;m thir&mdash;why, Willie, I&rsquo;m fourteen now.
I forgot all about my birthday this year. But no wonder,
I was fourteen the day after we captured Kaskaskia the
fifth of July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie stood as tall as he could. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m almost as
old as you, Jim. I&rsquo;ll be fourteen the second of January.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Jim was almost a head taller than Willie. He looked
down at the younger boy and smiled. &ldquo;You will? I
thought you were about twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be short, but I can do lots of things that men
can&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Willie replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure of that,&rdquo; Jim agreed.</p>
<p>Father Gibault was delighted with the amount of
honey and wax that the boys brought back, and gave half
the honey to Jim for Colonel Clark and his men. When
Willie told him Jim would like to work alongside of him,
Father Gibault said he would put in a good word for him
to Monsieur Cerr&eacute;.</p>
<p>A few days later Jim went with Willie to the fur depot
to see Monsieur Cerr&eacute;. The merchant put him to work
with Willie, sorting and counting the pelts which Indians
and French <i>voyageurs</i> had brought into Kaskaskia during
the fall and winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Jim and Willie became the best of friends, spending
many long evenings together either at Willie&rsquo;s house or at
Colonel Clark&rsquo;s headquarters. Jim taught him to play his
drum; Willie was such an apt pupil and so filled with
rhythm that he soon played as well as Jim. In return Willie
taught Jim all the gay lilting French songs he knew.</p>
<p>Jim enjoyed living in Kaskaskia; if his parents had
been with him, he would have willingly spent the rest of
his life among the French. They were a gay light-hearted
people, always ready to stop work and have fun.</p>
<p>The men played cards endlessly on the outdoor galleries
until winter winds drove them indoors. There were
many church festivals to attend, dances for the boys to
watch and always excellent food. At Christmas time
there were many gay parties given for the French citizens
and Clark&rsquo;s soldiers.</p>
<p>On New Year&rsquo;s Day of 1779 came the best day of all.
The whole village turned out in its finest clothes to call at
the homes of well-to-do folk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>And what a colorful procession they made; the men
wore silken hose and bright silver shoe buckles, their
richly trimmed coats open to show their fancy, embroidered
waistcoats; the women dressed in feathered finery
imported from France by way of New Orleans and the
Mississippi River. Ordinary French settlers wore buckskin
trousers and long colored cotton shirts belted in by
colored bead sashes tied behind, and topped by the familiar
blue <i>capots</i>. Now and then there appeared in the
crowd a soldier in an ancient French uniform, or a <i>voyageur</i>
in his leather ruffled shirt and brightly colored cap
with bobbing tassel.</p>
<p>Jim found life good in Kaskaskia until one afternoon
in late January. On the twenty-ninth day of the month
Jim came home from work and met a well-dressed gentleman
just leaving Colonel Clark&rsquo;s headquarters. Jim
wondered who this man was.</p>
<p>As Jim walked into the house, George Rogers Clark
was pacing the floor and running his hand nervously
through his shock of red hair. He didn&rsquo;t even see Jim
come in, but continued to pace back and forth. Jim took
off his coat and hung it in the closet. Then he came back
into the large living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is something wrong, Colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Clark stopped and turned toward Jim. &ldquo;Hello, Jim. I
didn&rsquo;t hear you come in. Yes, I&rsquo;ve just received some bad
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the gentleman who was leaving as I came into
the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you see him? That was Francis Vigo, a Spanish
merchant from St. Louis. I had asked him to see
about Captain Helm&rsquo;s supplies, since he was going on a
merchandising trip to Vincennes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Jim waited, seeing Colonel Clark was quite
upset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no word from Captain Helm for a long
time,&rdquo; Clark continued. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not like Helm, so I
was a bit uneasy. Vigo told me that he himself was captured
and taken to Fort Sackville. There he was confronted
by Lieutenant Governor Hamilton. You see,
Jim, Hamilton captured Fort Sackville on the seventeenth
of December and Captain Helm is now his prisoner.
The British are again in control of Fort Sackville
and Vincennes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Jim gasped. &ldquo;Do you mean Hamilton from Detroit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very same. He took all of Vigo&rsquo;s merchandise
from him and wouldn&rsquo;t release him until Vigo promised
not to return to Kaskaskia on his way home to St. Louis.&rdquo;
Clark smiled wryly. &ldquo;Vigo kept his promise too. He
went home to St. Louis, then came over here immediately
to tell me about Helm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked puzzled. &ldquo;What does it mean for us now
that Hamilton is in Vincennes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vigo told me Hamilton plans to attack Kaskaskia as
soon as the weather permits, some time in the spring.
He&rsquo;s supposed to have an army of eight hundred men,
counting the Indians and his prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight hundred!&rdquo; Jim gasped. There weren&rsquo;t eight
hundred people in the two towns of Kaskaskia and Cahokia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Colonel Clark resumed his pacing back and forth as
though he had forgotten Jim. After a time he stopped
suddenly. &ldquo;Attack at once, Jim. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
He brought his fist down hard in the palm of his hand.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only chance. We&rsquo;ll attack Hamilton now when
he thinks it&rsquo;s impossible. But we&rsquo;ll make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s blue eyes sparkled reflecting Clark&rsquo;s confidence.
&ldquo;Yes, sir. What can I do to help you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run to Father Gibault&rsquo;s and ask him if he will come
to my headquarters at once. Then see if you can find
Captain Charleville and tell him to report to me immediately.
But do not tell them or anyone else what I have
just told you. Do not even mention Vigo&rsquo;s visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark then called one of his officers who had
been asleep upstairs. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he nodded toward the man
as soon as he appeared, &ldquo;ride to Cahokia tonight. Tell
Captain McCarty to bring his company back from Cahokia
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the officer.</p>
<p>Jim dashed out of the house toward Father Gibault&rsquo;s,
while Clark&rsquo;s officer mounted his horse and set off at a
gallop for Cahokia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Father Gibault and Captain Charleville returned to
headquarters with Jim almost immediately. George
Rogers Clark told them the bad news of Vincennes and
what he had in mind to do.</p>
<p>Father Gibault looked grave for a few minutes and
then said, &ldquo;Colonel Clark, I&rsquo;m not a military man, but I
think your plan of attack is good. God willing, you will
make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Charleville sat forward in his chair. &ldquo;Colonel
Clark, there aren&rsquo;t many of your Virginia volunteers here
now, but I&rsquo;m sure I can raise a company among the villagers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark nodded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to have volunteers,
Charleville. I don&rsquo;t have more than eighty men, including
the men under Captain McCarty at Cahokia. I&rsquo;ve
sent for him to return with them. We can&rsquo;t do anything
more until morning, gentlemen. Thank you for responding
so quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a full company raised before sunset tomorrow,
sir,&rdquo; Captain Charleville promised.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THROUGH THE DROWNED LANDS</span></h2>
<p>The next morning Father Gibault rang the church bell,
signaling all people to assemble at the church. Immediately
the villagers came streaming out of their houses or
stores. Colonel Clark and Jim waited outside for them to
appear. Jim had brought his drum, and played it loudly
to attract their attention.</p>
<p>Willie Watson came running to the church; when he
saw Jim, he pushed through the crowd to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the excitement, Jim? What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;
Willie asked breathlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Jim didn&rsquo;t lose a drumbeat as he replied, &ldquo;Wait and
find out, Willie. Colonel Clark is going to talk to the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as everyone was quiet, Father Gibault told
them that Colonel Clark had an important message for
them. Then Colonel Clark told them that even now
Hamilton was in command of Vincennes and was planning
to attack Kaskaskia as soon as the weather permitted.</p>
<p>Before the citizens could recover from this shock,
Clark had outlined his plan of an immediate march on
Vincennes and a surprise attack on Fort Sackville. He
said he would need volunteers to help build a supply boat
he would send ahead for his army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help. I&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; came the cry of the men from
every quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll help, too,&rdquo; the women cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make
flags for your army. You&rsquo;ll need banners to carry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Colonel Clark smiled and nodded. &ldquo;Those of you who
will help with the boat and supplies, step over on this side.
And you who will volunteer to go to Vincennes, sign up
with Captain Charleville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men quickly made their choices, and Jim began to
play his drum again to interest the men in joining Captain
Charleville&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; asked Willie, who had stood quietly up to now,
&ldquo;are you going to Vincennes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Willie. I haven&rsquo;t asked Colonel Clark, but
he&rsquo;ll be needing a drummer, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going, I am, too,&rdquo; Willie said, excitement
making his voice shrill. &ldquo;I think my mother has a rifle
which belonged to my father. I can take it with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked doubtfully at Willie. &ldquo;Can you fire a rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie shook his head. &ldquo;No, but I can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim grinned. &ldquo;It takes a lot of practice, Willie, but I&rsquo;ve
an idea. If you&rsquo;ll let me have your father&rsquo;s rifle, I&rsquo;ll let
you take my drum. You can play it well, and I&rsquo;ve had
experience with rifles. My father taught me to use one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie smiled. &ldquo;Will you, Jim? Sure&mdash;you can have
the rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d better say anything to Colonel
Clark until it&rsquo;s time to go,&rdquo; Jim cautioned. &ldquo;He might
think of an excuse to keep us from going with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jim. Mum&rsquo;s the word, but I&rsquo;ll manage to
get the rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By nightfall Captain Charleville had raised his company
of Kaskaskia volunteers. The women were so enthusiastic
about the undertaking that they worked furiously
for the next two days, making flags of various colors
and designs. When they were presented to Colonel
Clark, he didn&rsquo;t know what he would do with so many
flags. But he thanked the ladies gravely and packed their
gift with the army supplies.</p>
<p>On the third of February Captain McCarty arrived
from Cahokia with his volunteers. That same day the
men finished work on the riverboat, which Clark had
named the <i>Willing</i>. They had made it into a warship
equipped with armament of two four-pounders and four
swivels. It required a crew of forty men to man, and
Clark put Captain John Rogers in charge of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>He ordered Rogers to go down the Kaskaskia and Mississippi
Rivers to the Ohio and ascend the Ohio and Wabash
Rivers; then he was to take his station thirty miles
below Vincennes and wait there for further orders. The
next day Captain Rogers and his crew set out on the warship
with supplies, stores and ammunition.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of February fifth,
Clark&rsquo;s army was ready to march. Jim had had to talk
long and hard to get Clark&rsquo;s permission to go with the
troops; he had made no mention of Willie. But Willie
stood beside Jim, carrying his father&rsquo;s rifle, which protruded
above his head.</p>
<p>As the army, one hundred-thirty men strong, stood
waiting, Father Gibault made a little talk to the men and
gave them his blessing and absolution. All the women
and men not able to go with Clark were on hand to bid
the troops good-bye and wish them Godspeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>George Rogers Clark rode in front on a magnificent
stallion, followed by his officers, also mounted. Jim
Long-Knife Hudson, wearing an ill-fitting buckskin suit
and beating his drum, stepped out proudly. Willie Watson
dropped back to the rear of the second company, fearing
Colonel Clark would see him and send him home because
of his age and size.</p>
<p>The rest of the men, clad in worn buckskin trousers
and hunting shirts, swung out jauntily, their heads held
high. Some carried rifles and some tomahawks, since
there weren&rsquo;t enough rifles for everyone. A motley array&mdash;Clark&rsquo;s
pioneer army, and at the same time a magnificent
column of spirited soldiers.</p>
<p>The whole of the flat Illinois country between Kaskaskia
and Vincennes was freezing water and half-frozen
mud. Two hundred and forty miles lay between the
army and Vincennes, but the men bravely started out. By
nightfall, however, they had covered only three miles. It
was rainy and drizzly, so they spent an uncomfortable
night without tents or shelter of any kind. The next day
they remained in camp.</p>
<p>That night Colonel Clark spied Willie Watson for the
first time. &ldquo;Willie!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Willie trembled but stood his ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m marching
with you to take Fort Sackville, sir,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Clark shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young, Willie, for
this trip. If I had seen you earlier, you would have remained
at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie grinned mischievously. &ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;ve taken
pains to stay out of your sight, sir. I was afraid you
wouldn&rsquo;t let me come along. And I&rsquo;m fourteen years old,
as old as Jim Hudson. I brought my father&rsquo;s rifle too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clark smiled and then shook his head. &ldquo;I admire your
spirit, Willie. Can you fire your rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie shook his head slowly. &ldquo;No, sir, I can&rsquo;t. But
Jim is going to take my rifle and I&rsquo;ll play his drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark looked grave. &ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s too late to
send you home, Willie, I guess you&rsquo;ll just have to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie smiled. &ldquo;Oh, sir, thank you. I&rsquo;ll make it. You
won&rsquo;t regret my coming, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the soldiers marched for nine hours, then
pitched camp in a square on the driest ground they could
find, putting their baggage in the center.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>As they continued through succeeding days they
marched sometimes through water up to their armpits.
They had to hold rifles and powder high above their
heads to keep them dry.</p>
<p>In desperation Clark and his officers dismounted and
piled the baggage on their horses. The animals struggled
along through the water with the men.</p>
<p>If any men happened to see any wild game, Colonel
Clark gave them time to shoot it. Now and then they
bagged a deer and on the twelfth of February they sighted
a herd of buffalo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Willie,&rdquo; Jim called, &ldquo;take my drum and give
me your rifle. Maybe I can get a buffalo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie handed over the rifle, as Jim noticed with satisfaction
it was exactly like his father&rsquo;s. He dashed out
with two soldiers to shoot one of the buffalos. He went
as close as he dared to the herd, took careful aim and
fired. His buffalo dropped immediately as did several
others which the men shot. In a few minutes they had
dragged the buffaloes over toward the fires.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="1042" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Jim,&rdquo; Willie said, clapping him on the
back excitedly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll eat plenty tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clark&rsquo;s army did eat a good meal and had entertainment
afterward. Willie and Jim sang many of the songs
they had learned together, and took turns playing the
drum. Willie also danced a strange mixture of French
and Indian dances until he was exhausted.</p>
<p>That evening the two boys helped boost the morale of
Clark&rsquo;s army more than anyone else save the colonel himself.
Colonel Clark was quick to give them credit. &ldquo;We
could never have made it this far, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without
your music and dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were exhausted from their performance; Jim
was too tired to say a word. But Willie grinned at Colonel
Clark and said, &ldquo;I told you, sir, you wouldn&rsquo;t regret letting
me come with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>During their first six days this remarkable army
marched over one hundred and seventy-four miles, averaging
twenty-eight miles a day. The hardest part of the
trip, however, lay before them&mdash;&mdash;the sixty-three miles to
Vincennes. They would have four rivers to cross&mdash;two
branches of the Little Wabash, the Embarrass and the
Great Wabash, all of them now swollen by floods.</p>
<p>When the army reached the two Little Wabash
branches, normally three miles apart, the men were
stunned to see a sheet of water almost five miles across,
with no dry banks or channels for either branch in sight.
The shallowest place was about three feet deep; what
the greatest depth was, no man knew.</p>
<p>Colonel Clark ordered his soldiers to halt while he considered
what to do. For a few minutes he gazed at the
great expanse of water, then ordered some of the men to
build a pirogue. This took only a day to build. Then he
ordered a few others to explore these drowned lands and
if possible, find a dry camping spot on the far bank of the
second branch. Once they found a trail, they marked it
with blazes on all trees above the waterline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>But how to get the loaded pack horses across both
branches of the river? The horses could wade to the first
channel easily enough, but when in deep water they
would have to swim, and they could not swim with their
heavy packs. Once again Colonel Clark solved his new
problem. He had his men build a scaffold in a shallow
spot beyond the second river bank.</p>
<p>When this was finished, the men unloaded the horses
and moved the baggage over to the scaffold in their pirogue.
Then they swam the horses through both channels,
reloading the animals at the scaffold. They also
ferried any ill, weak soldiers across both river branches.</p>
<p>As Colonel Clark himself plunged into the water, he
expected the rest of his army to follow him along the
tree-blazed route. But the men hung back, complaining
they were already cold and wet enough without wading
another five miles.</p>
<p>Suddenly Willie Watson, seeing Colonel Clark floundering
through the water alone, seized Jim&rsquo;s drum and
started into the water, beating the drum as hard as he
could. &ldquo;Come on, you,&rdquo; he called, beating a terrific roll.
Jim plunged in right behind Willie, holding his rifle high
above his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Soon the water was up to Willie&rsquo;s armpits. He pushed
the drum down and sat on it, floating along and paddling
the water with his drumsticks. &ldquo;Come on, you fellows,&rdquo;
he called. &ldquo;Somebody give me a push.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A French sergeant, almost six and a half feet tall,
charged into the water, scooped up Willie and his drum,
put him on his shoulders and shouted, &ldquo;Advance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie&rsquo;s courageous antics turned the trick for Colonel
Clark. While Willie played and sang at the top of his
lungs, the rest of the soldiers waded into the water and
did not turn back, though in some places the water came
up to their chins. But no dry spot could be found, so they
had to spend the night in shallow water without food.</p>
<p>Somehow they continued to march through the ice-cold
drowned lands until they had crossed the Embarrass
and Wabash Rivers. Here the men in their soaking wet
clothes were more discouraged than ever. This was the
place where the <i>Willing</i> was supposed to be waiting for
them. The warship, however, had not arrived.</p>
<p>The next day the camp awakened to a dull boom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Willie cried, poking Jim who lay beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jim mumbled. &ldquo;Sounded like guns,
didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One soldier overheard the boys and said, &ldquo;Colonel
Clark said those were the British morning guns at Fort
Sackville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re almost there,&rdquo; Jim cried, jumping up and
stretching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost there!&rdquo; sneered another soldier. &ldquo;Take a look
at that water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Willie asked, rubbing the sleep out
of his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About nine miles below Vincennes on the banks of
the Great Wabash!&rdquo; a nearby soldier exclaimed. &ldquo;But
how we&rsquo;ll ever get across that flood water I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
Several more men began to complain, and some even
muttered about going home.</p>
<p>Jim and Willie looked around and saw Captain
McCarty&rsquo;s men cutting down poplar trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Willie,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what they&rsquo;re
going to do with those trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys went over to help drag the poplars to a dry
area where the men could build canoes. They worked all
day and by evening had finished two. Meanwhile the
boys saw two more drifting aimlessly on the flood waters,
so they waded out and captured them. Now Colonel
Clark had four canoes to ferry his army over some of this
vast expanse of river.</p>
<p>The next morning it was raining again and the water
was still quite cold. Though the soldiers still had had
nothing to eat, the stronger ones began ferrying the
troops over to a small hill called Bubbie. From here they
waded to a larger hill, clutching trees and bushes in the
water to steady themselves. The canoes went alongside
to watch for any sick men.</p>
<p>Those who were able built fires on the opposite side of
the river and marched the exhausted men up and down
in front of the fire to revive them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>At last they reached Warrior&rsquo;s Island, a dry spot of
about ten acres. From here Clark planned to attack Fort
Sackville. The men had to rest, however, before he could
order the attack.</p>
<p>A day or two later, some of Clark&rsquo;s scouts brought two
Indian squaws and two half-grown boys into camp and
presented them to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want with these people?&rdquo; Clark demanded.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything to feed to my own men, to
say nothing of four prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir,&rdquo; one scout replied. &ldquo;They had food in
their canoe. It was filled with kettles, tallow, corn and
half a quarter of buffalo meat. We have it here, but what
shall we do with these Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food!&rdquo; cried several of the men near the colonel.
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make some buffalo stew for the men immediately,&rdquo;
Clark ordered. He looked at the trembling Indians. &ldquo;I
guess we&rsquo;ll have to take these prisoners to Vincennes
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Just at this moment Jim and Willie came up to the
colonel. When Jim saw the Indians, he stopped and
stared as if he didn&rsquo;t believe his own eyes. Then he
dashed over to the taller Indian boy. &ldquo;Wahbunou!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou tried to smile, but was too frightened to
talk. He just grabbed Jim and clung to him.</p>
<p>George Rogers Clark looked at Jim in amazement.
&ldquo;Jim, do you know this boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; Jim cried, &ldquo;this is Wahbunou, my Potawatomi
friend that I told you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark looked keenly at the boy and then at
Jim. &ldquo;Is this the boy who did not tell his people about
seeing the Long-Knives marching that summer afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clark smiled at the Indian boy. &ldquo;Well then, Wahbunou,
I am sorry we had to take your food. But my men
have had nothing to eat for several days. You are no
longer a prisoner of Chief Long-Knife. All four of you
are free to take your canoe and return home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Wahbunou did not understand all that Colonel Clark
said to him, but when Jim interpreted, the Indian boy
nodded his head and smiled.</p>
<p>George Rogers Clark shook hands with Wahbunou
and said, &ldquo;If you will come to Fort Sackville in a few
days I&rsquo;ll pay you for your food. Unfortunately, I have
nothing to give you for it tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou nodded again, spoke to his Indian companions
and motioned for them to follow him. They
found their canoe and paddled rapidly away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the men were busy making buffalo stew.
When it was ready the weakest men were fed first.
Though there wasn&rsquo;t enough stew to go around, it revived
many exhausted soldiers and improved the spirit of
all the soldiers.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CAPTURE OF VINCENNES</span></h2>
<p>From their camp the men could see the hundred cabins
making up the town of Vincennes, and Fort Sackville
over which the Union Jack was flying. If settlers in Vincennes
turned toward Warrior&rsquo;s Island, they could see
American soldiers; so George Rogers Clark employed a
trick of war to make them think he commanded a large
army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>While the men were resting after their taste of buffalo
stew, two more of Clark&rsquo;s scouts came into camp bringing
a very frightened Frenchman from Vincennes. They
said they had found him lurking near the camp. Willie
and Jim had been sitting near the colonel and could hear
everything he said to the Frenchman.</p>
<p>Clark spoke sternly to the man cowering in front of
him. &ldquo;I will permit you to go into town under certain
conditions. First you are to alert all French inhabitants
and tell them we will take Vincennes tonight. They are
to stay in their houses, keep quiet and not to let any one
at Fort Sackville know of our presence. Oh, yes, and tell
them to have a fine supper ready for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;And to think you&rsquo;ve
marched all the way from Kentucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clark did not correct the man&rsquo;s guess about Kentucky.
He merely said, &ldquo;Now you may go, but do not go near
the fort.&rdquo; As the Frenchman hurried to Vincennes to deliver
his message, Colonel Clark watched through his
field glass to see that he did not go to the fort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>About sunset Clark ordered his army to assemble.
When they were in their respective companies, with Jim
and Willie in front, Colonel Clark said, &ldquo;I ask just one
thing of all of you&mdash;<span class="smaller">OBEDIENCE</span>. Absolute <span class="smaller">OBEDIENCE</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; every man replied.</p>
<p>Clark turned to Jim and Willie. &ldquo;You boys bring out
the flags which we brought from Kaskaskia. We have
good use for them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys went over to the small stock of supplies they
had succeeded in bringing through the water, and took
out the flags. These had been so well packed they were
not even damp. There were twenty-four in all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each officer is to have a pair of flags mounted on
poles,&rdquo; Clark said.</p>
<p>The officers mounted several flags as Clark had directed.
Willie and Jim wondered what they would do
with the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;See that small hill between us and the town?&rdquo; Clark
pointed to a hill about halfway to Vincennes. &ldquo;You are
to march your men around and around that hill, every
sixth man carrying a flag so far as possible. Thus you will
give the effect of many divisions, each carrying its flag, to
anyone watching from Vincennes. When I give the order,
you march around that hill until dark. Then I will
issue your orders for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Clark led the line of march, followed by Willie
Watson with the drum, Jim Hudson, Captain McCarty
and the first of the color bearers. They marched around
and around the hill in plain view of the townspeople.
Should anyone be watching, he might easily assume that
George Rogers Clark had at least a thousand men at his
command.</p>
<p>Finally night fell. Tension was mounting among the
men. Now, now was the time for attack. How many
men did Hamilton have? Had this army come all
through the drowned lands to suffer defeat? Never,
while they drew breath.</p>
<p>Such thoughts were in the mind of every man when
Colonel Clark suddenly snapped them to attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Baily,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;take fourteen of your
best men and begin firing on the fort as soon as we have
reached Vincennes. Then cease firing for a few minutes
and laugh loudly as though you were firing for amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The lieutenant stepped forward and called out fourteen
men.</p>
<p>Colonel Clark went on. &ldquo;I will lead the rest of this
army to the heights behind Vincennes and enter the upper
part of town. The sentinels on the stockade walls
won&rsquo;t be able to see us, because part of the town lies between
our line of march and their garrison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he set out with the main army toward Vincennes,
while Lieutenant Baily marched his fourteen men toward
the stockade.</p>
<p>Jim and Willie, marching with the main army, became
so excited they could scarcely set one foot after the other.
In no time at all Clark&rsquo;s army took possession of the main
street and posted guards. Scarcely anyone was in sight
because of Clark&rsquo;s order for the people to remain in their
houses. Jim was assigned to guard duty; Willie went
with Colonel Clark on his rounds through the town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>In a little while Willie came hurrying back to Jim.
&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The people have supper ready for us.
We&rsquo;re going to take turns eating. Colonel Clark said he&rsquo;d
send a man to relieve you shortly, and you&rsquo;re to come
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this moment there was a burst of rifle fire, then
the sound of raucous laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our men have begun the attack, Willie,&rdquo; Jim cried,
peering into the black night. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon take Vincennes
and the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was, however, no answering fire from the fort.
In a few minutes another volley of shots rent the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go nearer to the fort, Jim, and see what&rsquo;s going
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Willie. I&rsquo;m on guard
here, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another burst of fire by the Americans, there was
a sudden, answering roar from the guns inside the fort.</p>
<p>Just at this moment Colonel Clark appeared with a
man to relieve Jim. &ldquo;You boys eat your supper. Report
back here when you&rsquo;ve finished, Jim,&rdquo; Clark said, and
went on to direct the firing which was now continuous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="984" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jim. I know where we&rsquo;re supposed to go.&rdquo;
Willie led the way to one of the villagers&rsquo; homes, where
seven or eight soldiers were just finishing their meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, boys,&rdquo; called a rosy-cheeked woman.
&ldquo;There is plenty of food for all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys sat down to a bountiful dinner of roast duck,
the best meal they had eaten since their buffalo feast
many days ago. While they were eating, the woman kept
staring at Jim. Finally she said, &ldquo;Soldier, have I seen you
before? There&rsquo;s something very familiar about your
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked blankly at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, ma&rsquo;am. I
don&rsquo;t recall ever having seen you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still she looked at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure queer. You remind
me of someone. I can&rsquo;t quite figure&mdash;say, what&rsquo;s your
name? Mine&rsquo;s Jeanne Duval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim smiled. &ldquo;Sometimes I&rsquo;m called Jim Long-Knife.
The Indians gave me that name. But my real name&rsquo;s Jim
Hudson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hudson!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed, her voice shrill with excitement.
&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s your home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any home now except
with Colonel Clark. I used to live in Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky, you say. I wonder if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roar of cannon from Fort Sackville cut off her
words. Jim and Willie jumped up. &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,
for the good dinner. We can fight better now,&rdquo; Jim said,
as they started out the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the fighting&rsquo;s over, come back here, Jim.
Come back for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jim replied, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys made their way back to Jim&rsquo;s post and found
it in the thick of the fighting. American soldiers were
pouring the hottest fire possible into the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Willie,&rdquo; Jim said as he got his rifle ready, &ldquo;look
at those gaps in the stockade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the British poked an artillery piece out of a
porthole, while the Americans sent a shower of well-directed
balls into it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Willie, &ldquo;got some British that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intense firing from both sides went on until about
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Then Colonel Clark withdrew
all his troops save a few observation parties, and
the firing ceased.</p>
<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock George Rogers Clark sent a flag of
truce into the fort with a message to Hamilton asking
him to surrender immediately. This Hamilton refused
to do and the firing began anew. But three hours later
Hamilton sent out a flag asking for a three-days&rsquo; truce.
Clark refused, but offered to have a conference with
Hamilton in the church at once.</p>
<p>While Clark waited for his answer, everyone outside
the fort, French and Americans alike, watched the fort
gate to see what would happen. Willie and Jim were in
the front row, waiting as impatiently as the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; Willie cried. &ldquo;Look! The gate is opening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed it was. Out came a dignified man in the
striking red uniform of a British colonel of regulars, a
handsome Indian and a grinning American.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;That man in red must be Hamilton himself,&rdquo; Willie
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Captain Helm!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim. &ldquo;You
know he&rsquo;s been Hamilton&rsquo;s prisoner since last December.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men walked on to the church. There they
were met by George Rogers Clark and Captain Bowman.
All of them went into the church to hold their conference.</p>
<p>The villagers all began talking at once, wondering
what would happen next. The American soldiers relaxed
a little, but still held their rifles.</p>
<p>As Willie and Jim started to walk up the street, a
woman ran out from the crowd calling to them. &ldquo;Boys!
Jim Hudson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim turned and recognized Jeanne Duval. She was
calling and beckoning to him. &ldquo;Come with me, Jim. To
my house.&rdquo; She nodded toward Willie. &ldquo;You may come
too, lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only stay a minute, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Jim replied, glancing
back at the church. &ldquo;Colonel Clark might want me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Just come on.&rdquo; She hurried on ahead and
rushed into her house. When the boys appeared she
said, &ldquo;Sit down a minute. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; Then she
disappeared out the back door.</p>
<p>Willie shook his head. &ldquo;What kind of business is this,
Jim? Do you suppose it&rsquo;s a trap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Willie. After all we
aren&rsquo;t such important people in Clark&rsquo;s army. She&rsquo;s probably
going to feed us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments she returned with a thin, tired-looking
blond woman. Jim stared at her for an instant, then
rushed over and swept her into his arms. &ldquo;Ma! Ma!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;At last! I&rsquo;d almost given up hope of finding
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma Hudson was laughing and crying at the same time.
&ldquo;Jim, how you&rsquo;ve grown! Why, you&rsquo;re a man! Jim
dear, we knew you were alive and well in Kaskaskia.
Captain Helm told Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Helm? But he&rsquo;s a prisoner of Hamilton.
And where is Pa?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Ma looked worried. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s still alive in the fort.
Pa and I are also Hamilton&rsquo;s prisoners. Pa&rsquo;s probably had
to man the guns against the Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against his own countrymen!&rdquo; Jim gasped. &ldquo;How
do you happen to be outside the fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma shrugged her thin shoulders. &ldquo;Since there wasn&rsquo;t
any place for women in the fort, the British put me in one
of the French homes here. And the people have been
good to me.&rdquo; She smiled at Jeanne Duval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been staying right next door,&rdquo; Jeanne explained.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I was so excited last night when
I saw you. You look so much like your ma, and when
you told me your name, I was sure you were her boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get away from the Shawnees and reach
Vincennes, Ma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma Hudson sighed. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get away from them,
Jim. I think they intended to take us up north to Hamilton,
but the snows came and they weren&rsquo;t able to get
through to Detroit. It was a rugged winter, with not
much to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Jim frowned. &ldquo;How did you and Pa get down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last autumn the Shawnees heard Hamilton was
marching south, so they rode to meet him and traded us
for some guns and blankets. Hamilton brought us
down here with other prisoners. I&rsquo;ve been mending for
Hamilton&rsquo;s soldiers and sewing some for the people here.
Your pa has been helping repair the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim had forgotten all about Willie while talking with
his mother. Suddenly he remembered him and said, &ldquo;Ma,
this is my best friend, Willie Watson. He&rsquo;s from Kaskaskia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma smiled at Willie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to know you, Willie.
You must have wonderful people in Kaskaskia, because
Jim looks so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same to you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; stammered Willie, bobbing
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be getting back now, Ma,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see you when Hamilton surrenders. Don&rsquo;t worry about
Pa. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s all right and will be free as soon as Colonel
Clark takes over here.&rdquo; Jim turned to Jeanne Duval.
&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am, for all you&rsquo;ve done for Ma and me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>When the boys returned to the American lines, the conference
was over. No one was certain, however, that
Hamilton would agree to the surrender terms. Colonel
Clark took no chances of deception by the British; he
posted guards in houses near the fort and patrols in town.
The rest of his army slept on their rifles and got their
first real rest in many days.</p>
<p>The next day, February 25, 1779, Hamilton sent Captain
Helm to Colonel Clark with the signed articles of
surrender. George Rogers Clark then drew up his army
in two lines facing each other in front of Fort Sackville
to await Hamilton. All of Vincennes gathered behind the
American army to see the surrender.</p>
<p>Promptly at ten o&rsquo;clock the wooden fort gate opened,
and Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton led his well-drilled,
scarlet-clad regulars of the King&rsquo;s regiment between the
lines of the ragged American soldiers. Captain Helm,
amidst loud hurrahs from the crowd, hoisted the American
flag above Fort Sackville. Fort Sackville and Vincennes
were now in American hands, never to be surrendered again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Hamilton&rsquo;s prisoners of war were also turned over to
Colonel Clark, among them Pa Hudson. When Jim spied
him in the group, he forgot all about his duty as a soldier
and rushed over to throw his arms around his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I knew I&rsquo;d find you sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father hugged him hard. &ldquo;Ma and I knew from
Captain Helm that you were safe in Kaskaskia, but we
didn&rsquo;t know when we could get to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the celebrations and ceremonies of surrender
were over, George Rogers Clark dispatched a detail to
Virginia with Hamilton, his prisoner of war, and sent
home the French who had accompanied the British leader
from Detroit.</p>
<p>Then Clark looked over the stores and supplies in the
fort. In them he found much clothing which had been
sent from Detroit for the British troops. From this supply
every man in Clark&rsquo;s army received new shirts, caps,
vests and trousers. These were most welcome gifts because
the men wanted to be presentable when they returned
in triumph to Kaskaskia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="1119" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>The Indians near Vincennes must have heard about
Clark&rsquo;s gifts, because early one morning several of them
came to the fort to receive presents from Chief Long-Knife.
Jim was helping to distribute these when he recognized
Wahbunou in the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Wahbunou, Colonel Clark,&rdquo; he said as the Indian
boy approached them.</p>
<p>Colonel Clark smiled and extended his hand to Wahbunou.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to be paid for that buffalo meat
and corn, I suppose. Well, boy, I&rsquo;m glad to pay you. They
saved our lives and made it possible for us to take Vincennes.&rdquo;
The colonel himself looked through the supplies
and brought out two magnificent blankets. &ldquo;Can
you use these blankets, Wahbunou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou&rsquo;s eyes shone as he took the blankets.
&ldquo;These are very good, Chief Long-Knife. I have been
paid plenty. I am glad my people could help Jim&rsquo;s people.
Jim is my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Jim took Wahbunou to one side. &ldquo;My parents are here,
Wahbunou,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were Hamilton&rsquo;s prisoners,
but now they are free. Won&rsquo;t you stop and see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wahbunou beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are with them. I
can&rsquo;t stop now, but Wahbunou will see your mother when
he comes to Vincennes again soon. Your mother was
very kind to me.&rdquo; Then he turned and went back to the
other Indians.</p>
<p>Before Colonel Clark led his men back to Kaskaskia, he
took Willie Watson to make a call on the Hudsons. Pa
Hudson wanted to return to his farm in Kentucky and
asked Colonel Clark if he would advise going.</p>
<p>Clark was silent for a few minutes, then shook his
head. &ldquo;Not yet, Hudson. Why don&rsquo;t you stay here until
summer? If everything is favorable then, you and your
family can return to Kentucky. I&rsquo;ll be back in June as
we intend to march on Detroit.&rdquo; Then he turned to shake
hands with Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a good soldier, Jim Long-Knife. They
don&rsquo;t come any better than you. I&rsquo;ll say good-bye now
and expect to see you when I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes misted as he said, &ldquo;Thanks for everything,
Colonel. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie had been unusually silent during the call. Now
he said, &ldquo;Good-bye, Jim. Take care of yourself. I&rsquo;ll miss
you more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; his voice broke and he could not finish
what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>Jim clapped Willie&rsquo;s shoulder affectionately. &ldquo;Good-bye,
Willie. You stay with Colonel Clark and the Long-Knives
and you&rsquo;ll be all right. See you in June.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />FLORANCE WALTON TAYLOR</p>
<p class="center"><i>Illustrated by</i>
<br />DIRK GRINGHUIS</p>
<p>Boys and girls living at the time of our War of
Independence, took an active part in that struggle.
Out West, they not only fought the British, but the
Indians as well. Kaskaskia and Vincennes were not
just towns, but stood for hard battle and hard won
victory.</p>
<p>Jim Hudson, named Jim Long-Knife by Chief
Minnemung is a pioneer boy living in Kentucky.
How he is separated from his parents, how he lives
with the Indians, and how he fights alongside
George Rogers Clark, is a story filled with suspense
and courage. Jim has good friends, including the
Indian boy Wahbunou, but it is his drum that,
many times, keeps him from danger.</p>
<p><i>Shemolsea</i>&mdash;Long-Knife is an important part of
early western history&mdash;and Jim helped make it so.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
